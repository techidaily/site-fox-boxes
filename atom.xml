It is the best product for cinematographic needs and you could easily imagine it hovering on the top to capture scenes for Hollywood movies. You will find a 5200mAh battery on top portion of this drone, located near power button. It appears little heavier with the gimbal, camera and battery installation, the overall weight goes up to 3.35 pounds. Note that, you need to get your drone registered with FAA to organise its flights because the weight goes above 0.5 pounds limit. You will find indicating LEDs on this device that keep on indicating full status during its flights and they can be observed in day light too. Users need to connect this device with a smartphone or iOS device to avail full control as well as to get live preview of shoots.</p><h4 id="3-Battery-Life"><a href="#3-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="3. Battery Life"></a>3. Battery Life</h4><p> Solo makes use of a very heavy and large battery that has 5200 mAh rating and can serve users up to 22 minutes in air. This is average rating for a drone unit and is comparable to popular DJI Phantom model that offers about 28 minute flight time. The battery takes about 70 minutes to get fully charged so you may need to wait so long to make it ready for the next flight. You cannot connect any third party charged to this device and also third party batteries are not supported. If you want to buy the spare batteries from 3DR then you need to pay $149&#x2F;battery.</p><h4 id="4-Flight-Performance"><a href="#4-Flight-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4. Flight Performance"></a>4. Flight Performance</h4><p> This device possesses very simple and intuitive controls for flight with automated landing and takeoff feature. When you are ready for the flight, switch your drone and wait for one minute so that it can activate the GPS system and then press fly button. It will immediately move in the air and hover at about 4 feel height from ground. There are numerous flight modes over which users can easily switch from application: four video modes and five advanced flight modes. If you are a beginner in the world of drones then you may probably love its autonomous flying feature. In this mode, drone takes all flight decisions itself instead of depending on application based controls.</p><h4 id="5-Control-Range"><a href="#5-Control-Range" class="headerlink" title="5. Control Range"></a>5. Control Range</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3dr-solo-controller.jpg"                      alt="3dr solo controller"                ></p><p> The 3DR solo controller appears trendy with just two joysticks that offer direct control to acceleration, yaw, pitch and roll. The fly button can be accessed for initiated automated landing and takeoff. A tiny screen is provided to display continuous information about battery condition and telemetry data. One additional knob is available for adjustments of camera angle controls. Other then this you will find one customizable button to activate autonomous flight mode. It also provides one pause button that helps users to make their drone stable in air. All other controls can be managed from application.</p><h4 id="6-Camera"><a href="#6-Camera" class="headerlink" title="6. Camera"></a>6. Camera</h4><p> If you need to record videos or stills in air using your drone then you need to invest on one additional product. Buy a GoPro camera for your drone and soon it will become able to get best aerial shots for you. This camera is connected to drone via control and HDMI cable and all the captured shots are sent back to drone as well as to the controlling application. You can also change device settings via application. 3DR solo is compatible with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Hero 3+ and 4 and they allow users to shoot 4K videos at 60 fps frame rate with ease. One can also make adjustments for frame rate as well as resolution from application to have customized control over videos.</p><h4 id="7-Repairable"><a href="#7-Repairable" class="headerlink" title="7. Repairable"></a>7. Repairable</h4><p> You will be glad to know that 3DR solo is a repairable drone and 3DR keeps on selling all parts for this product. You will get everything ranging from rotor blades to quadcoper legs at reasonable price range. Everything is managed with easy to replace mode where users can easily take the old faulty parts out and new ones can be placed inside within very less time. All the rotors have colour coding on them so that users can easily assemble them at right locations. Most of the users review that few parts of this drone are fragile. Commonly, rotor blades demand replacements as they get damaged with crashes and if your drone hits the ground very hard then you may also need to replace its frame. But the process of replacement is very easy.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10 Must Have drone accessories and parts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-photopea-guide-to-clean-image-canvases-for-2024/"><u>[New] Photopea Guide to Clean Image Canvases for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-clear-image-purchases-no-more-watermarks/"><u>2024 Approved  Clear Image Purchases  No More Watermarks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-best-radio-drama-scripts/"><u>[New] Best Radio Drama Scripts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-cost-cutting-options-for-purchasing-gopros/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Cost-Cutting Options for Purchasing GoPros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-captivating-collections-frames-and-organizers-of-the-future-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Captivating Collections  Frames & Organizers of the Future for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-dissecting-the-user-experience-in-vivavideo/"><u>[Updated] Dissecting the User Experience in VivaVideo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-watermark-wisdom-for-every-photographers-toolkit/"><u>2024 Approved  Watermark Wisdom for Every Photographer's Toolkit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-your-photography-getting-acquainted-with-snapseed-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Your Photography  Getting Acquainted with Snapseed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-quick-clip-creations-role-and-music-tango/"><u>2024 Approved  Quick Clip Creations  Role & Music Tango</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-idevices-recording-tools/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to iDevices Recording Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/the-pros-guide-from-playback-to-perfected-overwatch-recordings/"><u>The Pro's Guide  From Playback to Perfected Overwatch Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/actionable-tips-on-how-to-post-on-reddit-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Actionable Tips On How to Post on Reddit - Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-secrets-of-high-quality-steam-gameplay-footage/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Secrets of High-Quality Steam Gameplay Footage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/unleash-creativity-the-newcomers-snapseed-tutorial-for-2024/"><u>Unleash Creativity  The Newcomer's Snapseed Tutorial for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/how-to-generate-a-noise-free-avi-version-for-presentation-purposes/"><u>How to Generate a Noise-Free AVI Version for Presentation Purposes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-upgrade-apple-iphone-se-2022-without-data-loss-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Upgrade Apple iPhone SE (2022) without Data Loss? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-oppo-find-x6-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Location On Facebook Dating for your Oppo Find X6 | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Although the factors vary from individual to individual since it is more of the bodily response rather than the design variation.</p><p><strong>1. Use Q&#x2F;E in games when available.</strong> Since motion sickness is a big time issue for the developers, Oculus Rift games have this enhanced feature which can quickly move your character while turning by pressing Q or E key.</p><p><strong>2. Lock your eyes.</strong> When we move around in real life, our eyes do not run in parallel with our body. So the same should happen inside the virtual environment. Locking your eyes at a fixed point while turning in a game can avoid the issue.</p><p><strong>3. Reduce the speed of your character.</strong> By moving your game character at a slow speed might just help you reduce nausea and sick feeling. Excitement increases the brain activity and thus increases the chance of feeling sick.</p><p><strong>4. Take breaks.</strong> When we play video games we do not realize how time flies and how much time we have spent in a VR environment. More exposure would tend to cause more sickness. It is suggested that you take frequent breaks during your games and give your brain the time to relax</p><p><strong>5. Close your eyes when the camera is not controlled by head movements.</strong> This may sound silly but it truly helps since motion sickness is eventually tied to misunderstanding between body and brain. Body thinks you are moving, and your brain doesn’t.</p><p><strong>6. Don’t play games that make you sick.</strong> Some of the blame game can be put on the nature of games as well. Playing intense games for longer period of time might give you some dizziness when you stop.</p><p><strong>7. Correctly calibrate Oculus Rift for your eyes.</strong> When you play games, you might get blurriness and you don’t know how to fix it. That is probably due to your head gear that isn’t calibrated accordingly. That can also be a reason that gives you headaches.</p><p><strong>8. Lower the brightness.</strong> Some users say that lowering the brightness can help you reduce the sickness level. Some games have brightness adjuster that you can use to your choice.</p><p><strong>9. Eat or drink products containing ginger.</strong> Ginger has been used as a treatment for motion sickness for centuries. Although it does not work for everyone, people have been using it with high success rate.</p><p><strong>10. Try not to move your head a lot.</strong> Since motion sickness directly corresponds to movement, reducing your head movement left and right and up and down in one place can help you lower the chances of sickness.</p><h2 id="What-Oculus-have-done-to-reduce-motion-sickness"><a href="#What-Oculus-have-done-to-reduce-motion-sickness" class="headerlink" title="What Oculus have done to reduce motion sickness"></a>What Oculus have done to reduce motion sickness</h2><p> With the new, innovative VR devices and the head gear technology has taken a huge leap. Oculus Rift has become widely popular among its enthusiastic users. When Oculus released its first Development kit (DevKit 1) the users experienced the symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, sweating and vomiting. Even Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe experienced “motion sickness” with his own product, while using last year’s “DevKit 1” prototype. These sickness issues were so common while using DevKit 1 that its users called it the “Rift Sickness”.</p><p> Since Oculus Rift DK1 came to the market, people were really unhappy with the sickness it gave to them. Oculus saw that issue as a big threat, and started to develop DK2 with a much better display. In the original DK1, Oculus Rift used the liquid crystal display (LCD) to display visual in its devices. LCD screen had been of very much advantage because of its brightness, geometric distortion, and less electricity consumption. But it still had been promoting to the sickness issue because of its sluggish motion time response. In replacement of LCD screens, Oculus Rift has introduced OLED (organic light emitting diode) screens which have proved to be a much better idea. Experiments of Oculus Rift with OLED screens have been successful so far in reducing motion sickness to its minimal.

It lacks somewhere in few abilities when compared with BD-J7500 but it doesn’t mean that it cannot provide you desired services. Users will be able to access built in Wi-Fi, DLNA Streaming and internet apps via this device. In simple words, you will get so much by paying only £90 and it will easily stand in competition with most of the brands like Panasonic, LG and Sony. The article below provides detailed comparison between these top range devices as per most important specifications.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>You will definitely love its 3D Blu-Ray Playback ability.</li><li>Offers DLNA file streaming services.</li><li>It extends support to opera TV internet applications.</li><li>Dual Band type built in Wi-Fi connectivity.</li><li>Lovely curved design with durable body.</li><li>Quite impressive operation with faster speed and improved disc loading abilities.</li><li>Budget friendly unit.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Catch up TV apps are not launched yet.</li><li>It does not offer high resistance audio streaming facility.</li></ul><h2 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h2><p>With a price tag of $99.99 and combination of all mind-blowing features Samsung has set a great competition against $249, J7500 that was earlier rated as an all dancing player. In combination with those spinning discs, Samsung BD900 offers stunning streaming services over YouTube, Amazon, Netflix, Dailymotion, AccuWether, CinemaNow, YuppTV and Hotlist etc. If you are a serious streaming customer then you would definitely love to connect Roku over it.</p><p>The well designed player also offers easy selection services for Opera TV applications and the best news for you all is that it is 3D compatible. Further, you will enjoy Miracast screen sharing option on this compatible android handset. However, those who are searching for analog outputs may move ahead to J7500 design. Considered device possesses HDMI port with coaxial digital output facility; hence it becomes standard selection for low budget buyers. If your first most requirement is internet then J900 can be easily connected via onboard dual band type Wi-Fi as well as via Ethernet. How can be forget its DLNA file streaming services, they are quite useful and equally impressive. Users can easily play various popular file formats on this DLNA file streamer like JPEG, MP3, WMV, AVI, XviD and DivX etc. In case if you want to access high resolution files like MKV then it is good to make connections via USB port as DLNA will not be able to process that with desired quality.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/j5900-1.jpg" alt="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TKOSUMW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vs-flora-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00TKOSUMW&amp;linkId=25688c1c92e968f15c0196de22dab53e"></p><p>Check at Amazon</p><h2 id="Design"><a href="#Design" class="headerlink" title="Design"></a>Design</h2><p>Professionals say that this player can make the hallmark record in the budget friendly yet feature rich category of devices. Users love its plastic type finish with lightweight body work that makes it look more appealing. The curved shape is almost same as those curved soundbars and TVs offered by Samsung. Although, it is not best in all terms but still its eye-catching appearance makes it stand out among high end competitors.</p><p>You will find a slim disc tray on this device that is controlled via well designed Open and Close buttons. Front end also consists of one USB port that allows easy connectivity to external HDDs and Flash Drivers so that music, photos and videos can be accessed with ease. Same as many competing units in the market, Samsung BD900 possesses compact and slim design that can be placed easily in your less spacey apartments. The simple line up further consists of HDMI output, coaxial output and Ethernet. Most of the users love to use this HDMI port for making connectivity with TV or AV Receiver.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/j5900-2.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Operation"><a href="#Operation" class="headerlink" title="Operation"></a>Operation</h2><p>Samsung has designed J900 with user friendly offerings where quick start mode provides fast access to services and players runs in less than half second. The basic Wizard will help users to navigate through key settings like Wi-Fi connectivity etc. You will definitely appreciate its ability to work with ultimate graphics offering perfect colour blending. And the helpful descriptions on screen assist new users for better controls.</p><p>You will find least information on home screen and Samsung has tried to keep it least cluttered. Large files are displayed here via Logos and thumbnail images. The interface is divided into several sections like Music, Video and Photos. The last three controls on screen help users to make selection for changing externally connected devices; it can be DLNA server, Disc or a USB drive. There is wide range of options available on bottom row that provide quick access to various applications, setup menu and Screen Mirroring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/j5900-3.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h2><p>Performance of Blu-Ray players is often tested in terms of speed offered by them. When this comparison was earlier carried out on last year models then J5900 was proven to offer best speed response but this device is not modified now. However, J900 performed equally well. The Netflix loading was also good but it takes much time to work with Roku. When we talk about buttons of this device then they are also quite slower in generating response as can take up to 3 seconds.</p><p>Image quality tests were also conducted on J900 unit and impressively it provides great results as it provided clean delineation for all patterns under observation. DVD upscaling is another important test parameter and it was compared against Oppo BDP-105 for this feature, results were pretty good with little rippling jaggies.

This blu-ray player is great choice inside-out and supports wide range of user friendly settings with deep color details and 24p playback options. All popular audio standards are well supported by J900 like DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD but it lacks somewhere in 4K abilities. If you are searching for a player that can offer just basic features and falls in your tight budget range then Samsung J900 is best solution for you.

The colors were off, the blurry image and the white balance were blown out. If you have an iPhone or iPad, you know what I’m talking about. You’ve got a video that you shot on your iPhone. It looks great, but what if you want to make it a little more “professional”? There are times when you have dark lighting, or the sun is in your face, regardless of what’s causing the lighting to be dim.</p><p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, then videos are worth more than spoken language. Today the trend is high-quality videos on social media platforms, and your video should be perfect. But sometimes, we face trouble with our video. Not every video you take has the correct exposure or brightness. The video can have the wrong color balance, but a few tricks enhance iPhone video brightness within a few minutes.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How will brightness affect your video?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">3 Simple Methods to Brighten a Video on iPhone</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Adjust your video brightness and more using Filmora on PC&#x2F;Mac</a></p><h2 id="How-will-brightness-affect-your-video"><a href="#How-will-brightness-affect-your-video" class="headerlink" title="How will brightness affect your video?"></a>How will brightness affect your video?</h2><p>Brightness is one of the most significant factors in determining image quality. Anytime someone talks about color, they mention brightness. A system’s brightness can display light and dark details in an image. The ability to display brightness significantly impacts video quality because the video camera captures much brighter or darker images than standard video signals can handle. Brightness may be used as an important controlling factor for video effects (e.g., producing a realistic effect, making a shot more dramatic). However, if brightness is not well controlled, the desired effect of the scene may also change dramatically, and these changes will be visible to viewers.</p><p>Brightness, or the lack of it, will significantly impact how your video looks to your viewers. As you know, brightness and contrast affect how much information is revealed in an image. It depends on the brightness level to display the video with precise white balance, thus optimizing the video image quality. The brightness&#x2F;contrast settings should always be adjusted carefully during editing and mastering your videos to display colors and shades accurately.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-master-recommendations-best-audio-crafting-pros-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Master Recommendations  Best Audio Crafting Pros for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-mastering-film-making-top-video-cameras-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering Film Making  Top Video Cameras for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-total-gigabytes-for-an-entirety-of-daily-films/"><u>2024 Approved  Total Gigabytes for an Entirety of Daily Films</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-innovative-approaches-in-micro-cinematography/"><u>[Updated] Innovative Approaches in Micro Cinematography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/elevate-your-art-with-professional-color-alteration/"><u>Elevate Your Art with Professional Color Alteration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/in-2024-simplify-broadcasting-merge-obs-and-streamlabs-mac/"><u>In 2024, Simplify Broadcasting  Merge OBS and Streamlabs (Mac)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-journey-through-ipodverse-mastering-iphones-podcast-downloads-for-2024/"><u>[New] Journey Through iPodverse  Mastering iPhone's Podcast Downloads for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-discover-the-premier-5-ios-podcast-clients/"><u>2024 Approved  Discover the Premier 5 iOS Podcast Clients</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-icloud-on-iphone-11-smoothly-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Remove iCloud On iPhone 11 Smoothly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-comprehensive-razer-camera-study/"><u>[Updated] Comprehensive Razer Camera Study</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-surviving-the-block-top-houses/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Surviving the Block  Top Houses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-obscurity-to-the-limelight-the-proven-methods-of-changing-your-tiktok-username/"><u>2024 Approved  From Obscurity to the Limelight  The Proven Methods of Changing Your TikTok Username</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-add-personal-touch-to-videos-with-text-labels-using-photos-app-windows-11/"><u>[Updated] Add Personal Touch to Videos with Text Labels Using Photos App (Windows 11)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/acclaimed-internet-based-audible-normalization-applications-for-2024/"><u>Acclaimed Internet-Based Audible Normalization Applications for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/2024-approved-split-cut-and-trim-avi-files-like-a-pro-the-ultimate-tutorial/"><u>2024 Approved Split, Cut, and Trim AVI Files Like a Pro The Ultimate Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-remedy-for-audio-pause-in-obs-streams/"><u>In 2024, Remedy for Audio Pause in OBS Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mac-subtitle-editing-software-best-options-beyond-subtitle-edit/"><u>Updated In 2024, Mac Subtitle Editing Software Best Options Beyond Subtitle Edit</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Well, who wouldn’t want to make use of its high quality camera and powerful functionalities to capture the most alluring view! Nevertheless, most of the people fail to take better photos since they don’t know some key photography rules. If you are one of those, all you need to have is little more knowledge on photography composition rules. In today’s post, we have collated 10 golden photography rules that will empower you to steal the view perfectly with your iPhone. So let’s explore and make your photos even more stunning.</p><h2 id="Rule-of-Thirds"><a href="#Rule-of-Thirds" class="headerlink" title="Rule of Thirds"></a>Rule of Thirds</h2><p> The Rule of Thirds consists of a set of guidelines to assist a photographer correctly position the subject in a particular scene. It is meant to draw the attention of the viewer directly towards the subject. According to this rule, the picture is divided into nine equal grids that break the entire image with two vertical and two horizontal lines into vertical and horizontal thirds. As per the Rule of Thirds, the subject should be placed at the intersecting points of the grids.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rule-of-third.jpg"                      alt="rule of third"                ></p><h2 id="Leading-Lines"><a href="#Leading-Lines" class="headerlink" title="Leading Lines"></a>Leading Lines</h2><p> Leading lines add depth and scale to an image by leading the eyes into an image. When you want to capture a road running between two rows of trees, a suspended wooden bridge vanishing at a distant point, leading lines make sure that the picture is taken in such a way that the viewer’s eyes would follow your direction (here, the way you guide them along the rows of trees or the bridge vanishing in the horizon). Leading lines create a great impact on the photographs that you click with your iPhone and don’t let the observer wander away from your subject. The leading lines can be diagonal, straight, zigzag, curvy, or radial.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/leading-lines.jpg"                      alt="leading lines"                ></p><h2 id="Symmetry"><a href="#Symmetry" class="headerlink" title="Symmetry"></a>Symmetry</h2><p> For the perfect photo composition with an iPhone, one should understand what all make for the right composition. Photographers divide the frame they want to click into rough patterns and position the subject at the right place to get wonderful shots. Both man-made and natural symmetry and patterns represent eye-catching compositions. You can either take a shot following the symmetric patterns or break them to make the subject stand out by adding focal points and tension.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Symmetrical.jpg"                      alt="symmetrical"                ></p><h2 id="Framing"><a href="#Framing" class="headerlink" title="Framing"></a>Framing</h2><p> When we see a framed photograph, the frame brings out the beauty of the photograph. There are natural and man-made frames lying around. You just need to find that while clicking a picture. Framing the subject with such frames amplifies focus towards it, by isolating it from the world around. You can capture your subject through a hole, an arch, and different shapes and structures that you can visualize at that time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/framing.jpg"                      alt="framing"                ></p><h2 id="Diagonals"><a href="#Diagonals" class="headerlink" title="Diagonals"></a>Diagonals</h2><p> Diagonals are an integral aspect of photography composition, as they determine the outcome of a picture you have clicked using your iPhone. Let’s get to know what the role of diagonals in a picture is and how it impacts the visual. As you know the Rules of Thirds is important and it positions the subject of interest at a corner over the grid outlay of a photograph. It sometimes might leave the other corner empty and unbalance the image. Using diagonals, you can position the main subject and diagonally move the less important subjects towards the other end to click the perfectly balanced shot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/diagonal.jpg"                      alt="diagonal"                ></p><h2 id="Shape"><a href="#Shape" class="headerlink" title="Shape"></a>Shape</h2><p> Speaking of shape in photography composition sounds odd? ‘Rule of Thirds’ and ‘Leading Lines’ are not the only rules that make a photo composition. Line, shape, texture, form, space, color, and pattern also play a key role to make your iPhone photography a real treasure. Shape defines the two dimensional view of the subject and the entire scene as well. A well defined subject with a silhouette and backlighting or a black and white picture looks more appealing than a color picture where the shape of the subject or other objects is not prominent. Forms and shapes play an integral role in photography.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shape.jpg"                      alt="shape"                ></p><h2 id="Leave-Empty-Space"><a href="#Leave-Empty-Space" class="headerlink" title="Leave Empty Space"></a>Leave Empty Space</h2><p> You may wonder if I leave too much empty space in my photo contradicts the concept of ‘filling the frame’. But, it brings out the best for your iPhone photography when you have a strong subject in your scene. A clutter free and less distractive environment leads the viewers’ focus towards the main subject. You can think of clicking a giant statue against a clear blue sky, where the sky would act as a perfect background for the statue and render a clean look to the empty space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Space.jpg"                      alt="space"                ></p><h2 id="The-Direction-of-Subject"><a href="#The-Direction-of-Subject" class="headerlink" title="The Direction of Subject"></a>The Direction of Subject</h2><p> Like all the photography composition rules, it is important to take note of the direction of the subject in a photograph. This is known as the ‘Rule of Space’ and it leads the viewer towards the subject’s direction of motion. For example, if there is a person walking on the road, then there should be space ahead of him. If there is a person sitting in a bench or rock, he should be clicked facing into the frame, and there should be space in front of him. It will help the viewer’s eyes to go along with the direction he is facing and take notice of the other subjects such as, other people walking in front him, or any pet moving around etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/direction.jpg"                      alt="direction"                ></p><h2 id="Fill-Your-Frame"><a href="#Fill-Your-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Fill Your Frame"></a>Fill Your Frame</h2><p> Making your subject stand out against the entire frame in a photograph creates more impact. You can easily obtain this goal with your iPhone by covering the entire frame with your subject.

No matter if you want to shoot nature, urban life, beaches, clouds or sunrise, compacting a couple of hours of footage into a few minutes can be rather powerful visual narrative.</p><p>A time lapse video is basically a sequence of photos which have been shot at an interval and then player with a much faster speed. The time interval in which the photos have been shot could vary from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the duration of the video you want to create. This is substantially different from a regular video where the photos are recorded in quick succession by the camera and then stringed together in real time. Time lapses can be a very handy tool for recording scenes which occur over a considerable period of time (for eg. Sunset, sunrise, eclipses, budding of flowers, clouds etc).</p><p>Are you an amateur travel photographer who has recently bought a GoPro cam and wondering which the best setting for time lapse photography is? Are you still not certain about which editing software to use for editing your GoPro time lapses? In this post we will discuss how to shoot a time lapse video with GoPro Hero 5 and how to edit the video with Filmora.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1:Shooting a time lapse video with GoPro Hero5</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Making time lapse videos with Wondershare Filmora</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Shooting-a-time-lapse-video-with-GoPro-Hero5"><a href="#Part-1-Shooting-a-time-lapse-video-with-GoPro-Hero5" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Shooting a time lapse video with GoPro Hero5"></a>Part 1: Shooting a time lapse video with GoPro Hero5</h2><h4 id="1-The-best-time-lapse-settings-in-GoPro"><a href="#1-The-best-time-lapse-settings-in-GoPro" class="headerlink" title="1. The best time lapse settings in GoPro:"></a><strong>1. The best time lapse settings in GoPro:</strong></h4><p>Selecting the right setting is the most difficult part about shooting a GoPro time lapse. Here is what you need to do:</p><ul><li>At first, you need to set the right interval of shooting</li><li>Next, you need to choose the optimal resolution</li><li>Then, you have to select the exact playback rate</li><li>Lastly, you need to decide on the length of your video.</li></ul><p>Below parameters are the best time-lapse intervals for the GoPro Hero5 Black:</p><ul><li>0.5s for up-close shooting birds, insects and other small moving things;</li><li>1.0s for filming in urban areas like flowing traffic, people, buses etc;</li><li>2.0s for shooting clouds as well as touristy areas;</li><li>5.0s for filming sunset, sunrise and normal moving clouds;</li><li>10s for shooting moving clouds and construction videos</li><li>30s for taking shots of shadows, drying puddles, thunderstorms etc.;</li><li>60s for blooming flowers, growing plants or any other long term process.</li></ul><p>Choose 12 MP as the resolution and use 30 frames per second for your videos, which is the ideal settings for getting the most fluid-looking and realistic time-lapses. Now you need to decide on how long you want to shoot. While shooting at an interval of 60 seconds, you would have to place your camera on the location for quite some time, so as to get a time-lapse of considerable duration. If you shoot for 10 minutes with 1s interval, then you will be getting about 20 seconds of time lapse footage which is surely enough for creating a quick montage.</p><h4 id="2-Tips-before-your-shoot"><a href="#2-Tips-before-your-shoot" class="headerlink" title="2. Tips before your shoot"></a><strong>2. Tips before your shoot</strong></h4><p>First, you need to look for the right location. Make the most out of the rule of thirds and always ensure that you have a focal point of your time lapse footage. While shooting a crowded street try to position your camera at a vantage point from where you can capture the movement of the people and even that of the clouds.</p><p>Make use of good tripod, a fast and spacious SD card, a suction mount and always keep an extra battery. Gorilla Pod with its 3 in 1 mount is probably the best tripod for action cams. A longer cord can be of great help in situations where you have a power source. This would allow you to shoot hours and hours of footage on your GoPro.</p><h4 id="3-Steps-for-making-your-time-lapse-video"><a href="#3-Steps-for-making-your-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="3.

This template is fully customizable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/feature-action-ae-title-tempalte.jpg"                      alt="feature action ae title tempalte"                ></p><h3 id="2-Arrive-After-Effects-Title-Template"><a href="#2-Arrive-After-Effects-Title-Template" class="headerlink" title="2.

But like most After Effects title templates, it is entirely customizable, meaning that you can choose to keep its minimalistic design while changing the overall color scheme.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/black-white-ae-title-tempalte.jpg"                      alt="black white ae title tempalte"                ></p><h3 id="5-Cyber-Brush-Titles-After-Effects-Template"><a href="#5-Cyber-Brush-Titles-After-Effects-Template" class="headerlink" title="5.

The following is how you can edit titles in After Effects;</p><p><strong><em>1. Line Title Animation in After Effects</em></strong></p><p>Use this method to add a simple animation to your video’s title. This is an ideal solution if you don’t want your title to distract from the main content;</p><p>Step1 Start by creating a new composition and then go to the crosshair icon under the preview window and select “Title&#x2F;Action Safe.” This enables “Title Safe” which will add a guide to the screen to make sure your titles remain in the correct place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/line-title-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="line title animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Text Tool and type in your title. You can use the “Character Window” on the right to change the font, size, and formatting for the video.</p><p><strong><em>2. Adding A Shape Around the Title</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add a shape around the title just to make it stand out more, use these steps;</p><p>Step1 Select the Rectangle Tool and proceed to draw a shape around the title.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-a-shape-around-title.jpg"                      alt="add a shape around title"                ></p><p>Step2 Under “Fill” select “None” and under “Stroke,” set to “Solid Color.”</p><p>Step3 Then go to the “Shape Layer” and click on the drop-down arrow beside “Add” to choose “Trim Paths.” You can then increase the “Start” and “Offset” as needed.</p><p><strong><em>3. Animating the Lines</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to animate the lines, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Move the playhead to 1 second and click on the “Stopwatch” on the start icon. This will create a keyframe.</p><p>Step2 Then move the playhead back and begin to change the start value to get the desired effect.</p><p>Step3 Click on the Stopwatch icon again to create a new keyframe. Select all keyframes, right-click and go to Keyframe Assistant &gt; Easy Ease to ensure the animation starts and stops smoothly.</p><p><strong><em>4. Create an Exit Animation</em></strong></p><p>You can then close the animation loop by designing an exit animation. Here’s how to do it;</p><p>Step1 Select all the layers that you have created so far and then go to “Layers &gt; Pre-compose.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-on-exit-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="create on exit animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Move the playhead to about 3 seconds and then click on “Edit” and select “Split Layer.” Delete the top Split Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/delete-the-top-split-layer.jpg"                      alt="delete the top split layer"                ></p><p>Step3 Select the comp that is remaining and click on “Edit” to select “Duplicate.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/edit-duplicate-ae.jpg"                      alt="edit duplicate ae"                ></p><p>Step4 Right-click on the duplicated layer and choose “Time” to select “Time Reverse Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/time-reverse-layer-ae.jpg"                      alt="time reverse layer ae"                ></p><p>Step5 Move the duplicated layers to the right until you find that there are no gaps between the two layers.</p><p><strong><em>5. Add Color to the Animation</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add color to the animation to make it stand out a little bit more, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Create a new composition to create new text or if you already have text on your screen, go to Window &gt; Align and select an alignment that fits into your project.</p><p>Step2 Then click on “Effects” select “Gradient Ramp” and add the effect next to the text later.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-color-to-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="add color to animation ae"                ></p><p>Step3 Move the points on the screen to change the intensity and direction of the gradient as desired.</p><p>Step4 You can then use the “Effects Window” to change the color as desired.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p></article## Best Free After Effects Title Templates<p>The following are just some of the best After Effects title templates to choose from;</p><h3 id="1-Future-Action-After-Effects-Title-Template-1"><a href="#1-Future-Action-After-Effects-Title-Template-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

The following is how you can edit titles in After Effects;</p><p><strong><em>1. Line Title Animation in After Effects</em></strong></p><p>Use this method to add a simple animation to your video’s title. This is an ideal solution if you don’t want your title to distract from the main content;</p><p>Step1 Start by creating a new composition and then go to the crosshair icon under the preview window and select “Title&#x2F;Action Safe.” This enables “Title Safe” which will add a guide to the screen to make sure your titles remain in the correct place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/line-title-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="line title animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Text Tool and type in your title. You can use the “Character Window” on the right to change the font, size, and formatting for the video.</p><p><strong><em>2. Adding A Shape Around the Title</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add a shape around the title just to make it stand out more, use these steps;</p><p>Step1 Select the Rectangle Tool and proceed to draw a shape around the title.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-a-shape-around-title.jpg"                      alt="add a shape around title"                ></p><p>Step2 Under “Fill” select “None” and under “Stroke,” set to “Solid Color.”</p><p>Step3 Then go to the “Shape Layer” and click on the drop-down arrow beside “Add” to choose “Trim Paths.” You can then increase the “Start” and “Offset” as needed.</p><p><strong><em>3. Animating the Lines</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to animate the lines, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Move the playhead to 1 second and click on the “Stopwatch” on the start icon. This will create a keyframe.</p><p>Step2 Then move the playhead back and begin to change the start value to get the desired effect.</p><p>Step3 Click on the Stopwatch icon again to create a new keyframe. Select all keyframes, right-click and go to Keyframe Assistant &gt; Easy Ease to ensure the animation starts and stops smoothly.</p><p><strong><em>4. Create an Exit Animation</em></strong></p><p>You can then close the animation loop by designing an exit animation. Here’s how to do it;</p><p>Step1 Select all the layers that you have created so far and then go to “Layers &gt; Pre-compose.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-on-exit-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="create on exit animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Move the playhead to about 3 seconds and then click on “Edit” and select “Split Layer.” Delete the top Split Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/delete-the-top-split-layer.jpg"                      alt="delete the top split layer"                ></p><p>Step3 Select the comp that is remaining and click on “Edit” to select “Duplicate.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/edit-duplicate-ae.jpg"                      alt="edit duplicate ae"                ></p><p>Step4 Right-click on the duplicated layer and choose “Time” to select “Time Reverse Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/time-reverse-layer-ae.jpg"                      alt="time reverse layer ae"                ></p><p>Step5 Move the duplicated layers to the right until you find that there are no gaps between the two layers.</p><p><strong><em>5. Add Color to the Animation</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to add color to the animation to make it stand out a little bit more, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Create a new composition to create new text or if you already have text on your screen, go to Window &gt; Align and select an alignment that fits into your project.</p><p>Step2 Then click on “Effects” select “Gradient Ramp” and add the effect next to the text later.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-color-to-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="add color to animation ae"                ></p><p>Step3 Move the points on the screen to change the intensity and direction of the gradient as desired.</p><p>Step4 You can then use the “Effects Window” to change the color as desired.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/in-2024-essential-techniques-for-blurring-photos-on-iphone/"><u>In 2024, Essential Techniques for Blurring Photos on iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/maximizing-your-android-game-adventure-with-kinemaster-review-for-2024/"><u>Maximizing Your Android Game Adventure with KineMaster Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-discover-10-premier-stock-source-for-vectors/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Discover 10 Premier Stock Source for Vectors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-polarr-photo-magic-your-complete-image-processing-manual-for-2024/"><u>[New] Polarr Photo Magic  Your Complete Image Processing Manual for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploring-m1-capabilities-apples-laptop-dilemma/"><u>2024 Approved  Exploring M1 Capabilities  Apple's Laptop Dilemma</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-virtual-collaborations-blending-zoom-with-skype-techniques/"><u>[Updated] Enhancing Virtual Collaborations  Blending ZOOM with SKYPE Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-enhance-your-virtual-stage-the-ultimate-list-of-top-6-microphones-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhance Your Virtual Stage  The Ultimate List of Top 6 Microphones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-poco-f5-pro-5g-phone-with-broken-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Poco F5 Pro 5G Phone with Broken Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/stuck-at-android-system-recovery-of-vivo-s17-fix-it-easily-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Stuck at Android System Recovery Of Vivo S17 ?
