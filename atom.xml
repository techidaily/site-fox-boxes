For example, HDR photography involves taking images in dark and bright areas. But because these images might not show much to the naked eyes, you’ll need an HDR program like <strong>EasyHDR</strong>. This software can recreate and design incredible HDR photos on Mac and Windows computers. So, this review post advises you whether <strong>Easy HDR</strong> is worth the money or not. We’ll also advise on the best way to edit and create HDR videos on PC.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR"></a>Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>EasyHDR is an HDR photography software for highlighting image details in HDR photos.

It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.</p><ol><li><strong>Price – 4.7&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there’s a free demo version, it’s pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.</p><ol><li><strong>Supported OS – 5&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus.

And the $33&#x2F;lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.</p><p>But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it’s the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.</p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Simple layout.</li><li>Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.</li><li>Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.</li><li>Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.</li><li>Batch processing supported.</li><li>Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>It doesn’t have advanced HDR post-processing tools.</li><li>No HDR feature for editing.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR"><a href="#Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR"></a>Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR</h2><p>Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it’s important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can’t save HDRi in TIFF format. Let’s get in!</p><ol><li><strong>High-Quality Bracket Merging</strong></li></ol><p>A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.</p><ol><li><strong>Editing features</strong></li></ol><p>EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.</p><ol><li><strong>Ghost removal</strong></li></ol><p>No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>HDR batch processing</strong></li></ol><p>As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>LDR enhancement</strong></li></ol><p>Although we’ve mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it’s important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop"></a>Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop</h2><p>Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.</p><p>With that in mind, we recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for professional and semi-professional HDR editors.

Not everybody can afford professional lighting equipment for their YouTube channels. It’s a big investment, especially if you think of your channel as a hobby. Sometimes even if you have a lighting kit you do not want to set up multiple lights and stands to every time you shoot a vlog entry. You might be shooting them every day. It is great to have lighting equipment, and it is also great to know when you can get around it.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-Best-Natural-Lighting-Indoors"><a href="#How-to-Get-Best-Natural-Lighting-Indoors" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Best Natural Lighting Indoors"></a>How to Get Best Natural Lighting Indoors</h2><p> Using a window as your main light source is a simple way to get high quality lighting on a budget. When it is bright outside a window is as powerful as any light you might have. So, besides just being cheap, windows can actually make your YouTube videos look amazing.</p><h4 id="1-Windows-as-Key-Lights"><a href="#1-Windows-as-Key-Lights" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows as Key Lights"></a>1. Windows as Key Lights</h4><p> When you shoot near a window you can treat that window the same as the key light in a three-point lighting set up.</p><p> In three-point lighting you have a key light, a fill light, and a main light. Your key light, in this case your window, is off to one side. It will cast a shadow over half of your face which you soften using your fill light. Your backlight is a light you put behind you to help you pop out of your background.</p><p> Another thing that can help you pop out from your background is focusing your keylight so that its light is only landing on you, not your background.</p><p> Rather than setting up professional lights for your fill and backlights try using household lamps or reflectors. Reflectors are used to bounce light from another source, so if you set one up opposite to the window it will redirect light back at the shaded side of your face.</p><p> Reflectors are very affordable, often around $20, but if you do not have one then you can use a sheet of aluminum foil.</p><h4 id="2-Windows-as-Front-Lights"><a href="#2-Windows-as-Front-Lights" class="headerlink" title="2. Windows as Front Lights"></a>2. Windows as Front Lights</h4><p> Vlogging while facing a window is a great way to get even lighting over your entire face. This is a great set up for makeup tutorials or other beauty vlogs. It can also work for opinion vloggers, or any other vlogging genre where the focus is on a stationary host, though.</p><p> The only issue that can arise when you use a window as a front light for your vlog is that you do not stand out from your background because the lighting is even on both you and it. This is not difficult to get around; you just need a backlight.</p><p> You can use a household lamp or a reflector as a backlight. The idea is that the light hitting you from behind will create a boarder around you that will make you pop out from the background of your shot.</p><h4 id="3-Windows-as-Backlights"><a href="#3-Windows-as-Backlights" class="headerlink" title="3. Windows as Backlights"></a>3. Windows as Backlights</h4><p> It is usually a bad idea to use a window as a backlight because they are too bright. Shooting with a window behind you will not just give you a dark boarder, like a lamp or a reflector; it will completely transform you into a silhouette. This is an interesting effect in some situations, but not in a vlog where your viewers are expecting to be able to see you. It is sometimes possible to make this kind of shot work by increasing your exposure, but then you might end up with over-exposed footage. Pushing the ‘info’ button a couple times will allow you to check you exposure on most DSLRs.</p><h4 id="4-Diffusers"><a href="#4-Diffusers" class="headerlink" title="4. Diffusers"></a>4. Diffusers</h4><p> A diffuser is a screen of translucent fabric you can use to soften your light. The light coming from your window might be hard on your eyes, and setting up a diffuser between you and your window can help you not to blink. Often when reflectors come in colored sets one of the ‘colors’ will be translucent and you can use it as a diffuser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024s-guide-to-cutting-edge-cost-effective-storage/"><u>2024’S Guide to Cutting-Edge, Cost-Effective Storage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-revered-anthems-top-20-anime-opener-hits/"><u>2024 Approved  Revered Anthems  Top 20 Anime Opener Hits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-fly-high-with-gopro-karma-an-insiders-review/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Fly High with GoPro Karma  An Insider's Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-cutting-edge-video-assemblers-iphone-and-androids-best/"><u>2024 Approved  Cutting-Edge Video Assemblers  IPhone & Android's Best</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-use-face-id-to-pay-for-apps-on-iphone-15-pro-by-drfone-ios-unlock-ios-unlock/"><u>How to Use Face ID to Pay for Apps on iPhone 15 Pro?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/compelling-alternatives-to-obs-for-video-capture/"><u>Compelling Alternatives to OBS for Video Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/ranking-nations-on-a-scale-of-french-speaking-populations/"><u>Ranking Nations on a Scale of French-Speaking Populations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/simplifying-the-process-of-making-profitable-facebook-reels/"><u>Simplifying the Process of Making Profitable Facebook Reels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-crafting-self-narratives-100-unique-instagram-captions/"><u>[New] In 2024, Crafting Self-Narratives - 100 Unique Instagram Captions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/full-solutions-to-fix-error-code-920-in-google-play-on-honor-x50i-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Full Solutions to Fix Error Code 920 In Google Play on Honor X50i | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/stellar-data-recovery-for-iphone-13-mini-failed-to-recognize-my-iphone-how-to-fix-it-stellar-by-stellar-data-recovery-ios-iphone-data-recovery/"><u>Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone 13 mini failed to recognize my iPhone.

Researching all the numerous possibilities and choosing the appropriate service for you can be a mammoth process, leaving many people merely choosing one of the major brands, like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. The regular SSD or hard drive can no longer suffice with the quantity of data that needs to be stored, so the only option is to subscribe to a possible cloud storage service. The best way to store data in the cloud is through cloud storage, accessed from any location and device.</p><p>We’ve evaluated all the various cloud storage out there and put up this cloud storage comparison to make the task simpler. If you want to save money on storage, <strong>cloud storage pricing</strong> is essential when choosing the best cloud storage service provider.</p><p>So, read on as we discuss <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> below:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison"><a href="#Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison"></a>Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison</h2><p>Here is a table comparing top cloud storage providers’ free storage space and their <strong>cloud storage pricing comparison</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Cloud Storage Providers</th><th>Free Storage</th><th>Monthly Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple iCloud</td><td>5GB</td><td>50GB - $1200GB - $32TB - $10</td></tr><tr><td>Google Drive</td><td>15GB</td><td>100GB - $7.49250GB - $10500GB - $18.95</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB - $21TB - $72TB - $12</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB of storage for $2 per month or $20 annually</td></tr><tr><td>Dropbox</td><td>2GB</td><td>Plus: 2TB - $10Family: 2TB - $17.</td></tr><tr><td>pCloud</td><td>10GB</td><td>500GB - $50 a year2TB - $100 a year10TB - Custom</td></tr><tr><td>Sync.com</td><td>5GB</td><td>1TB - $6Unlimited - $15</td></tr><tr><td>Icedrive</td><td>10GB</td><td>150GB - $1.671TB - $4.175TB - $15</td></tr></tbody></table><p>However, Google Drive and Photos are already fine if you don’t wish to invest much money. For example, you can use Google Photos to store photos in the cloud.</p><p>The security and privacy of cloud services are crucial, correct storage capacity and device compatibility.</p><p>If security is your top priority, choose Sync.com, IceDrive, and pCloud. They are the most robust encryption and authentication system for cloud storage.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Price-Recommendations"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Price-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Price Recommendations"></a>Part 2: Best Price Recommendations</h2><p>Here we recommend the cloud storage services with the best prices in three categories.</p><h3 id="1-Best-price-of-lifetime-license-cloud-storage"><a href="#1-Best-price-of-lifetime-license-cloud-storage" class="headerlink" title="1.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Comprehensive-Introduction-to-Quantum-HDR-Principles"><a href="#A-Comprehensive-Introduction-to-Quantum-HDR-Principles" class="headerlink" title="A Comprehensive Introduction to Quantum HDR Principles"></a>A Comprehensive Introduction to Quantum HDR Principles</h2><p>‘Hello,</p><p>What is Quantum HDR, and how does it affect TV screen quality? Please explain to me”.</p><p>One of the fascinating aspects of technology is the never-ending innovation. However, TV terminologies can be quite confusing, that even new technologies in the industry become hard to understand.</p><p>Quantum HDR is one of the latest technologies in the TV industry that many folks still find too hard to understand.</p><p>Perhaps you’ve heard about Quantum HDR once or twice, but you still didn’t know what the technology is all about, worry less because you’ve come to the right page to find out the unknown.</p><p>Here, we’ve covered all you need to know about Quantum HDR. So it’s advisable that you read this article till the end.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Quantum-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Quantum-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Quantum HDR"></a>Part 1: What is Quantum HDR</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/quantum-hdr-everything-you-may-want-to-know-about-quantum-hdr-1.jpg"                      alt="quantum hdr"                ></p><p>Just as the name suggests, Quantum HDR is a combination of two amazing technologies namely, ‘Quantum Dots and HDR (High dynamic range).</p><p>“Quantum HDR refers to TVs with a QLED screen that’s compatible with the HDR technology.”</p><p>As we all know, HDR is used to capture more details and colors in images. So, when used in TVs, it usually affects the color accuracy and contrast ratio in images. Therefore, causing an increase in color accuracy and contrast ratio.</p><p>With the presence of HDR in TVs, bright colors become brighter, and details of pictures become more visible. Yes, it does this by increasing the maximum value for three base colors ‘Red, Green, and Blue’ - this causes colors that originated from the mix of the base colors to be brighter and more saturated.</p><p>Quantum, on the other hand, means a TV uses Quantum Dot technology - a new technology used in TV screens by industry brands like Samsung to capture more details and colors in images.</p><p>Screens made of Quantum Dot technology are also referred to as QLED. Yes, this is because such screens tend to display LED lights that use a unique black light different from other TV screens. So, as a result, TVs with such screens usually have higher brightness and contrast while preserving details of the picture.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-Quantum-HDR-16x-24x-32x-40x"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-Quantum-HDR-16x-24x-32x-40x" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What is Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, 40x?"></a>Part 2: What is Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, 40x?</h2><p>Quantum HDD 16x, 24x, 32x, and 40x are known as peak brightness multipliers of a TV screen. Although there’s clear information about these peak brightness multipliers at this point, we could tell it’s another marketing strategy relating to how many metadata streams a TV’s processor would process to make the image displayed on its screen more detailed. For example, since the base brightness of a TV is 100 units, a Quantum HDR with a 16x peak brightness multiplier would have a peak brightness of 1,600 units, Quantum HDR with a 24x peak brightness multiplier would be 2,400 units, and so on.</p><p>In all, we could say the overall brightness of a Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, and 40x increases as the peak brightness multiplier increases.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-there-a-difference-between-Quantum-HDR-and-HDR"><a href="#Part-3-Is-there-a-difference-between-Quantum-HDR-and-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Is there a difference between Quantum HDR and HDR?"></a>Part 3: Is there a difference between Quantum HDR and HDR?</h2><p>Even though Quantum HDR is a new technology, a lot of people still mistake it to be the same as HDR. So, to help clear the air on the difference between these two techniques, we’ve explained their features in the comparison table below;</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Quantum HDR</strong></th><th><strong>HDR</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Meaning</strong></td><td>Quantum HDR are TVs with QLED screen that’s compatible with HDR technology</td><td>HDR is an advanced technology that improves the quality and display signals of HDR TV (High dynamic range television)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Technology</strong></td><td>-</td><td>High dynamic range televisions</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Brightness</strong></td><td>Much Brighter</td><td>Much brighter</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Best for</strong></td><td>Televisions</td><td>camera</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cost</strong></td><td>$1000+</td><td>$20,000+</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-and-Display-Your-HDR-Video-on-Quantum-HDR-TV"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-and-Display-Your-HDR-Video-on-Quantum-HDR-TV" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make and Display Your HDR Video on Quantum HDR TV?"></a>Part 4: How to Make and Display Your HDR Video on Quantum HDR TV?</h2><p>Truth be told, your TV won’t be able to use HDR unless you’re watching HDR-ready media - It needs a source.

The holodeck was what true Virtual Reality should be, full body tactile immersion both narrative immersion, which occurs “when the viewer becomes emotionally invested in the story” and the feeling of “really being there”, called spatial immersion.</p><p> <strong><em>You may also like:</em></strong><br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Differences between VR, AR and MR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _<br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Virtual Reality Technology: Current State and Future Challenges <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _</p><h2 id="The-equipment-used-for-VR-is-very-expensive"><a href="#The-equipment-used-for-VR-is-very-expensive" class="headerlink" title="The equipment used for VR is very expensive"></a>The equipment used for VR is very expensive</h2><p> Of course with any early stage technology, there are a host of issues to overcome among the first is cost for consumers to participate. Many systems run between $100 and $600 and we have not yet discussed the cost of purchasing experiences or games.</p><h2 id="Low-resoultion-content-large-file-size"><a href="#Low-resoultion-content-large-file-size" class="headerlink" title="Low resoultion content, large file size"></a>Low resoultion content, large file size</h2><p> The new goggles or headsets that are coming out offer best available high resolution displays. But gaming experience is coming on at low resolution, leaving you with a low resolution experience. Below is a greatly condensed technical discussion explaining why VR is still so profoundly mediocre.</p><ul><li><strong>File size</strong></li></ul><p> Current VR platforms require a some kind of download to begin. Often the file sizes are over 1 GB and requisitely, slow.</p><ul><li><strong>Video quality</strong></li></ul><p> The next issue is simply video quality. Most VR is in stereo format and the hardware is just not able to fully support it. The video comes through grainy and muffled like it was shot that way and of course it was not. Improved resolution is the fix. There is another obvious thought here. Why claim to have a market worthy product when one of the fundamental technologies, viewing, is still unstable?</p><ul><li><strong>Resolution</strong></li></ul><p> What is the issue with fixing resolution. A couple of questions must be addressed to solve the problems. What is the display resolution? This is the screen resolution. The second question is, “Does all of the images that can come through, actually come through or is it cut off in some way?” This is field-of-view resolution. These questions have technical answers and industry engineers are working to provide a seamless solution, but we are brought back to the conclusion that VR technology while close to delivering true Phase I, which is reasonably easy to use technology is not quite there. Industry insiders use language like it is still in its experimental stage, of course that will not stop the industry from selling these units to early adopters.</p><ul><li><strong>Social Consequences</strong></li></ul><p> There is an addictive quality of Virtual Reality environments that should not be ignored. Those who are regular users of these spaces, even in its developmental state find that it can be hard to stay away. Users find themselves in some cases, preferring the virtual world to the real one. If these anecdotal experiences are being reported by a very small sample size what will be the impact on entire cultures that embrace this technology? Considerations of Virtual Reality must extend into the world of human activity and definitions of normal behavior. And as a reminder most of us who love science fiction have a sense of what true Virtual Reality really is. It should be clear that we are a very long way from enjoying the holodeck.</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Best-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editor: Wondershare Filmora"></a>Best Video Editor: Wondershare Filmora</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-secrets-of-9-high-quality-webcam-enhancements/"><u>2024 Approved  Secrets of 9 High-Quality Webcam Enhancements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-red-carpet-rollouts-top-picks-for-iphone-filmmakers-choices/"><u>2024 Approved  Red Carpet Rollouts  Top Picks for iPhone Filmmakers' Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-create-stunning-videos-add-slow-mo-effects-without-breaking-the-bank-filmora/"><u>New In 2024, Create Stunning Videos Add Slow Mo Effects without Breaking the Bank - Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-watch-hulu-outside-us-on-nokia-105-classic-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Watch Hulu Outside US On Nokia 105 Classic | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-understanding-and-mastering-video-content-on-yt-shorts/"><u>In 2024, Understanding and Mastering Video Content on YT Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/vdsm-video-recorder-prospectus-detailed-study-for-2024/"><u>VDSM Video Recorder Prospectus  Detailed Study for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-teachers-channel-blueprint-10-essential-tips-for-youtube-educators/"><u>[New] Teachers’ Channel Blueprint  10 Essential Tips for YouTube Educators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exclusive-review-of-showmore-authoritative-screen-capture-software/"><u>2024 Approved  Exclusive Review of ShowMore’ Authoritative Screen Capture Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/best-ways-on-how-to-unlockbypassswiperemove-realme-gt-5-fingerprint-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Best Ways on How to Unlock/Bypass/Swipe/Remove Realme GT 5 Fingerprint Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-unleash-video-potential-leading-youtube-seo-tools/"><u>In 2024, Unleash Video Potential - Leading YouTube SEO Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-innovative-approaches-to-harvest-large-amounts-of-tiktok-media/"><u>2024 Approved  Innovative Approaches to Harvest Large Amounts of TikTok Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-encyclopedia-to-youtube-thumbnail-mastery-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate Encyclopedia to YouTube Thumbnail Mastery for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-time-capsule-in-digital-form-storing-historic-pictures/"><u>2024 Approved  A Time Capsule in Digital Form  Storing Historic Pictures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/84518081-transform-spaceships-into-trees-youtubes-green-secrets-revealed/"><u>Transform Spaceships Into Trees – Youtube’s Green Secrets Revealed</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

In fact, the newest innovation is 360° video and although they both sound like the same technology, they are actually quite different.</p><h2 id="The-Differences-Between-VR-Video-and-360°-Video"><a href="#The-Differences-Between-VR-Video-and-360°-Video" class="headerlink" title="The Differences Between VR Video and 360° Video"></a>The Differences Between VR Video and 360° Video</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/difference-between-vr-360-video.jpg"                      alt="difference between 360 video and VR"                ></p><h3 id="Photography"><a href="#Photography" class="headerlink" title="Photography"></a>Photography</h3><p> When it comes to looking at the photography of both mediums, that is where you’ll see the most significant differences between both VR video and 360° video. In a virtual reality environment, the photography is created digitally, as mentioned it is referred to as a virtual environment, or VE. A team of professionals creates these landscapes, characters, and elements typically within a digital studio and with the help of computers and software programs.</p><p> In comparison, 360° video is captured from a real-life landscape. These live action videos are not reconstructions of things that you would see in your everyday life, they are real videos in real places that everyone has access to.</p><h3 id="Mobility"><a href="#Mobility" class="headerlink" title="Mobility"></a>Mobility</h3><p> It’s also interesting to consider the amount of mobility that viewers have when it comes to both types of video, as virtual reality is far more immersive than 360° video. With virtual reality the viewer or player has the ability to walk relatively anywhere and explore further into the landscape. The only thing that may prevent you from venturing too far is if you are tethered to a computer or any other device that is providing you with the artificial landscape. Otherwise, you can easily walk absolutely anywhere while you are immersed in the world.</p><p> On the other side, a 360° video only gives you a certain amount of viewing power. Since the filmmaker will have full control over the content that you see, viewers will only have the ability to get a full view of what the filmmaker has filmed. The movements of the filmmaker limit the entire viewing field.</p><h3 id="Timeline"><a href="#Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Timeline"></a>Timeline</h3><p> One of the main reasons as to why VR video is so popular amongst video game studios is because they can integrate a vast timeline to keep their players entertained. With virtual reality the timeline could be endless as you can create a series of events or different experiences that exist in a theoretical world. The way that the timeline progresses depends on the actions of the user, whereas with 360° video, the timeline progresses based on what the filmmaker has filmed.</p><h3 id="Platform"><a href="#Platform" class="headerlink" title="Platform"></a>Platform</h3><p> When you consider the platforms that are available for both mediums, it can be more cost effective to use 360° video as users can access the video from any device that offers viewing capabilities and that is compatible with 360° videos. For example, they can log onto their computers and visit free websites such as YouTube to watch the video. With virtual reality you have to purchase particular accessories that support the program you’re involved in. Typically these can be quite expensive; Sony is releasing a VR headset for approximately the same price as an entire console.</p><h3 id="Content-Story"><a href="#Content-Story" class="headerlink" title="Content&#x2F;Story"></a>Content&#x2F;Story</h3><p> Creating the content and the story for VR is far more in-depth than 360° simply because the filmmaker doesn’t have control over what the viewer sees. You have to ensure that every crevice is designed perfectly to capture the attention of the audience and to impress them. You also have to pay special attention to enticing them to want to immerse themselves more in the environment. It’s equally as important to capture the attention of the viewer with 360° video, though you have full control of what your viewers can see.</p><p> Overall, both technologies are interesting and have shaped the way that we view content on a regular basis. Virtual reality seems to be a more in-depth technology that allows players to explore a brand new universe, whereas 360° video is great for real-life applications.</p><h2 id="What-is-Virtual-Reality-video"><a href="#What-is-Virtual-Reality-video" class="headerlink" title="What is Virtual Reality video"></a>What is Virtual Reality video</h2><p> Virtual Reality videois something that has been discussed everywhere from sci-fi films to video games all over the world. With VR video you are given the ability to immerse yourself in a specific scene that has been created by an animator. It is essentially a way to allow the user to explore a virtual environment in real-time. In comparison to a 360° video, virtual reality is like it name suggests, a reality that has been virtually created for your exploration.</p><h2 id="What-is-360°-Video"><a href="#What-is-360°-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is 360° Video"></a>What is 360° Video</h2><p> If you’re a fan of major YouTube personalities, you’ve undoubtedly seen 360° video before as companies have been developing innovations that allow people to record their daily lives with a 360° view. With a 360° you’re given the opportunity to watch a video from all angles of recording. Meaning that although a person might be recording their face, you can use controls on your device to see to the left, to the right, and even behind the camera. It’s a great way to make the viewer feel like they are actually in the same room as the filming personality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Navigating-the-World-of-SRT-Files-on-YouTube-and-Twitter"><a href="#Navigating-the-World-of-SRT-Files-on-YouTube-and-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Navigating the World of SRT Files on YouTube and Twitter"></a>Navigating the World of SRT Files on YouTube and Twitter</h2><p>If you’re a content creator, then you should know the importance of adding subtitles to your videos.</p><p>Today, a lot of social media users, especially on Facebook, tend to watch videos without turning on the sounds. But the big question is ‘If your audience doesn’t turn on the sound of your videos, how do they get the message you’re trying to pass?” Well, this is why adding ‘Subtitles’ to your videos is crucial. However, for a subtitle to work, it needs to comply with the structure of a video player or any platform you intend to use it on. And fortunately, SRT is a universal format, making it usable on any social media platform.</p><p>In this guide, you’ll be introduced to the simple methods you can utilize to upload SRT files to social media platforms including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc. But before we proceed, let’s take a look at an overview of the different social media platforms and the subtitle file formats they support.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Social Media Platform</th><th>SRT</th><th>VTT</th><th>STL</th><th>SSA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>YouTube</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Vimeo</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>From the overview table above, it’s obvious you can easily create one SRT file and easily use it on different social media channels. This saves you the stress of creating different subtitle files for each platform. So, without further ado, let’s dive in to find out how to upload and add .srt files to different social media platforms.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos</h2><p>If you’re a YouTube video content creator, but you still don’t know the benefit of adding subtitles to your videos, let’s give you the top two main hints on how subtitles affect your videos;</p><ul><li>Subtitles help your videos to be understood not only by folks who hear and see but also by folks who have hearing problems. Hence helping your video to reach more audience.</li><li>You need subtitles to make your videos SEO rich as phrases in your subtitle can be used as keywords by Google when users search for stuff related to your video online.</li></ul><p>That being said, keep in mind that SRT subtitles and CC are two different things. Although they are often used interchangeably, they are both distinct. The only similarity CC and SRT share is that they’re text version of the audio aspect of videos.</p><p>CC, also known as Close Caption the words spoken in the video, and it allows viewers understand the information being passed in a video without necessarily turning on the volume.</p><p>SRT subtitles, on the other hand, are translations of the word that’s spoken in a video. For example, if you’re streaming Korean movie, but you don’t understand the language, you’d need a translation of the dialogue at the bottom of your screen. The English translation that’s displayed on your screen is known as the SRT subtitles.</p><p>Now you know how subtitles affect your videos, and what the difference between SRT and CC are, let’s proceed to learn how to upload SRT files to YouTube videos.</p><p>Step1Sign in to your YouTube channel and locate the ‘YouTube Creator Studio’. Then select ‘Subtitles’ on the right menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-1.jpg"                      alt="subtitles"                ></p><p>Step2Select the Video that you want to add SRT to. Then click ‘Add Language’ and select the language you wrote your Subtitle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-2.jpg"                      alt="add language"                ></p><p>Step3Click Add under the Subtitle section and upload your SRT file through the pop-up that appears on your screen.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Tweets"><a href="#Part-2-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Tweets" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Upload SRT Files to Tweets"></a>Part 2: Upload SRT Files to Tweets</h2><p>Before now, Twitter users can only upload SRT files to video via the ‘Media Studio’, but this feature was not available to all users, making it difficult for some users to add subtitles to their videos.</p><p>However, the new version of Twitter now allows users to easily add SRT files to their tweets from the ‘Compose Tweet’ area. This made uploading SRT to tweet very straightforward. All you just have to do is to compose a tweet with your video then use the “Upload Caption File (.srt)” option to upload the SRT file. See the process to complete the action below;</p><p>Step1Open Twitter on your device and click the relevant button to compose a new tweet.</p><p>Step2Upload the video you want to add the SRT file to.

Then you’ll see the name of the language in your captions is written</p><p>Step5Now play the video to preview the subtitle and if you’re satisfied, publish your tweet instantly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-tweets-3.jpg"                      alt="tweet instantly"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Your-Vimeo-Video"><a href="#Part-3-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Your-Vimeo-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Upload SRT Files to Your Vimeo Video"></a>Part 3: Upload SRT Files to Your Vimeo Video</h2><p>Vimeo is another platform that’s similar to YouTube.

Then verify that ‘Status’ is turned ON and select your file language and file type is SRT.</p><p>Step5Finally, hit the ‘Save’ button to complete the operation.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Facebook-Videos"><a href="#Part-4-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Facebook-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Upload SRT Files to Facebook Videos"></a>Part 4: Upload SRT Files to Facebook Videos</h2><p>Facebook is one of the biggest social media apps, and videos posted on the app have the potential of reaching millions of folks globally.

So, without further ado, let’s dive in to find out how to upload and add .srt files to different social media platforms.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos</h2><p>If you’re a YouTube video content creator, but you still don’t know the benefit of adding subtitles to your videos, let’s give you the top two main hints on how subtitles affect your videos;</p><ul><li>Subtitles help your videos to be understood not only by folks who hear and see but also by folks who have hearing problems. Hence helping your video to reach more audience.</li><li>You need subtitles to make your videos SEO rich as phrases in your subtitle can be used as keywords by Google when users search for stuff related to your video online.</li></ul><p>That being said, keep in mind that SRT subtitles and CC are two different things. Although they are often used interchangeably, they are both distinct. The only similarity CC and SRT share is that they’re text version of the audio aspect of videos.</p><p>CC, also known as Close Caption the words spoken in the video, and it allows viewers understand the information being passed in a video without necessarily turning on the volume.</p><p>SRT subtitles, on the other hand, are translations of the word that’s spoken in a video. For example, if you’re streaming Korean movie, but you don’t understand the language, you’d need a translation of the dialogue at the bottom of your screen. The English translation that’s displayed on your screen is known as the SRT subtitles.</p><p>Now you know how subtitles affect your videos, and what the difference between SRT and CC are, let’s proceed to learn how to upload SRT files to YouTube videos.</p><p>Step1Sign in to your YouTube channel and locate the ‘YouTube Creator Studio’. Then select ‘Subtitles’ on the right menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-1.jpg"                      alt="subtitles"                ></p><p>Step2Select the Video that you want to add SRT to. Then click ‘Add Language’ and select the language you wrote your Subtitle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-2.jpg"                      alt="add language"                ></p><p>Step3Click Add under the Subtitle section and upload your SRT file through the pop-up that appears on your screen.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Tweets-1"><a href="#Part-2-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Tweets-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Upload SRT Files to Tweets"></a>Part 2: Upload SRT Files to Tweets</h2><p>Before now, Twitter users can only upload SRT files to video via the ‘Media Studio’, but this feature was not available to all users, making it difficult for some users to add subtitles to their videos.</p><p>However, the new version of Twitter now allows users to easily add SRT files to their tweets from the ‘Compose Tweet’ area.

Importing videos"></a>1. <strong>Importing videos</strong></h4><p> First step for editing is importing the video files from the GoPro. Open the GoPro Studio and then, you will find a blue colour button on the top left corner of the window labelled as “Import New Files”. Click on that button and select the files that you want to include.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-1.jpg"                      alt="Import videos in gopro studio"                ></p><h4 id="2-Trimming"><a href="#2-Trimming" class="headerlink" title="2. Trimming"></a>2. <strong>Trimming</strong></h4><p> After you have imported the videos, cut the unnecessary portion of the videos that you are not interested to include, this trimming or cutting should be done before you start the actual editing.<br>For that, click on the thumbnails of the videos and then on “play”. This will result into playing the video. There are two trimming buttons on the left of the window that you can use for marking the beginning and ending of the clip which you want to include. In this way, you can select the number of videos clips that you want to include in your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-2.jpg"                      alt="Trimming videos in gopro studio"                ></p><h4 id="3-Changing-video-settings"><a href="#3-Changing-video-settings" class="headerlink" title="3. Changing video settings"></a>3. <strong>Changing video settings</strong></h4><p> If you want to change any setting like frames per second, size of the video, change format, increasing speed or any other setting; you can go to advanced settings and make the changes. Don’t forget to click on “remember setting” button after you have made the settings otherwise it will not save the settings that you would have made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-3.jpg"                      alt="Change video settings in gopro studio"                ></p><h4 id="4-Adding-files-to-convert-list"><a href="#4-Adding-files-to-convert-list" class="headerlink" title="4. Adding files to convert list"></a>4. <strong>Adding files to convert list</strong></h4><p> Now, you need to add the roughly trimmed files to the conversion list so that you can start with the editing. For that select the clip and then, go to “Add Clip To Conversion List”. In this way, add all the clips one by one to the list and they will appear on the right column of the GoPro window when added. In this step, you are also enabled to add the new videos, trim them at the moment and rotate them. Once you have added all the clips to conversion list, convert them by clicking on “Convert All” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-4.jpg"                      alt="hwo to use gopro studio"                ></p><p> On the completion of conversion, a pop up message labelled as “Proceed to Step 2” will appear on the screen and you need to click on that for proceeding to editing mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-5.jpg"                      alt="edit gopro videos"                ></p><h4 id="5-Adding-Title"><a href="#5-Adding-Title" class="headerlink" title="5. Adding Title"></a>5. <strong>Adding Title</strong></h4><p> Now, GoPro Studio will offer you two options; creating a totally new video or using the templates in the software. In the case you choose the second option, you need to do only one thing which is replacing the videos with the selected files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-6.jpg"                      alt="Create new videos"                ></p><p> For creating the new video, click on “Blank” button and then on “create”. Now, click on the “Title” button and type the title name that you want. You can also change the font size, colour and some other features of the title. After finalising the title, drag it to the “Drag videos here” option and if you want it to appear in the video, then you can drag it to “Drag title here”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-7.jpg"                      alt="Adding title with gopro studio"                ></p><h4 id="6-Adding-and-Editing-the-video"><a href="#6-Adding-and-Editing-the-video" class="headerlink" title="6. Adding and Editing the video"></a>6. <strong>Adding and Editing the video</strong></h4><p> Now, choose the video and add it by dragging and dropping to the timeline. After including the video, you can adjust the speed, fade time, brightness, volume level and many other features. You can also add the night vision feel to the video. As you have done in the importing; you can also adjust the duration of every clip that you are going to add in the video. Selecting the “Razor blade” symbol will divide the clip in two parts and if you click on “+”symbol, it will create the the fade effects in the video. The fade out effects are added so that the video will not end suddenly. So, when done with adding the clips then, add the fade out effect to the video. Click on the “Video Controls” and increase the limit on the fade out line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-8.jpg"                      alt="Edit gopro video"                ></p><h4 id="7-Adding-music"><a href="#7-Adding-music" class="headerlink" title="7.
