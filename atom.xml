    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Behind-the-Scenes-The-Top-7-Studio-Programs-for-Animators"><a href="#Behind-the-Scenes-The-Top-7-Studio-Programs-for-Animators" class="headerlink" title="Behind the Scenes: The Top 7 Studio Programs for Animators"></a>Behind the Scenes: The Top 7 Studio Programs for Animators</h2><p>Using software like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for editing your videos ready for uploading or release is fast and effective but first you have to get your files ready to import. We will be talking about 3d model creation today which is the first step in 3D animation creation. There are many options out there with their own advantages and drawbacks as well as price points and additional support via tutorials and in some cases assets to help speed up the creation process.</p><p>In every case you can always just buy ready-made models for your animations but in doing that you lose the option and the flexibility to have a completely custom asset with the ability to alter when needed.</p><p>There are many steps to creating that perfect video and in time you will have your preferred method. We call this our workflow. Achieving a comfortable workflow is one of the most important and influential processes you will undergo as a creative artist, this is due to the fact even with the best ideas and all the drive in the world, if you struggle to translate that into a 3d model then it stays in your head and no one will see it.</p><p>With this in mind let’s look at some of the options available to us and how we can use them for this first most important step in our creative process. Remember to pick one that does not limit your creativity and gives you the tools you need to translate thought into visualization.</p><h2 id="ZBrush-by-MAXON"><a href="#ZBrush-by-MAXON" class="headerlink" title="ZBrush by MAXON"></a>ZBrush by MAXON</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/zbrush-by-maxon.jpg"                      alt="zbrush by maxon"                ></p><p>Zbrush is what is considered an industry standard 3D modeling software and is one of the most used by many leading studios. This is a paid software with different versions meeting different needs depending on what you feel you need. You can create impressive 3d models with very high levels of detail without overusing your computer resources resulting in a stable and fluid working process. Zbrush is very powerful with many features, too many features to highlight in this guide but as an overview some features that can improve your process are:</p><ul><li>You can import or create alphas easily for micro detailing.</li><li>There is a live boolean to create unique items within your sculpts.</li><li>It’s very easy to use the Zremesher to create a new clean topology of your sculptures.<br> Dynamesh lets you work and retopo as you go so the sculpt retains detail.</li><li>Work with multiple levels of divisions at the same time with the Sub Divide tools.</li></ul><p>This is just a tiny scratch on the surface of what ZBrush can do. There are all the tools you need within this software to create an amazing jaw dropping model for your videos but this is a paid software which is important to remember when making the decision to go with this one as you will need animation and rigging software as well as in some cases a UV editor. Another thing to remember is system requirements depending on your setup. Minimum system requirements are as follows:</p><p><strong>For Windows:</strong></p><ul><li>64-bit Windows 10 or 11 .</li><li>Core 2 Duo or AMD equivalent with SSE2 technology or better.</li><li>4GB of ram with a strong recommendation for 6GB or more.</li><li>8GB of free hard drive space.</li><li>A graphics card with OpenGL 3.3 or higher and Vulkan 1.1 or higher.</li><li>Monitor with 32-bit color and a resolution of 1280x1024.</li><li>Mouse or Wacom compatible (WinTab API) pen tablet.</li></ul><p><strong>For Mac:</strong></p><ul><li>Mac OSX: 10.14 or above</li><li>Everything else is the same as above.</li></ul><p>Zbrush runs the same on Windows and Mac so there is no advantage over the other and the only real elements that you need to consider is your CPU and your RAM, A faster CPU with more cores will make this program run more stable and 16GB or RAM or more will also help with stability so if your running an older computer this will still work but you may be limited to pixel count but that is true for all 3D creation software.</p><h2 id="Autodesk-Maya"><a href="#Autodesk-Maya" class="headerlink" title="Autodesk Maya"></a>Autodesk Maya</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/autodesk-maya.jpg"                      alt="autodesk maya"                ></p><p>This guide wouldn’t be complete without introducing Maya, Maya is another industry standard for modeling but also offers animation and rigging tools meaning this covers a lot more ground that some of the other 3D modeling software.</p><p>Maya is very powerful but for this guide I will only be talking about the 3D modeling creation tools as I feel other topics need their own space but that said I think it is important to mention this is a complete workflow from creation to the exportation of your movie file into Filmora ready for editing and uploading to your audience.</p><p>Again this software has a list of features that is simply too large to cover so i will highlight some useful features for your creative process.</p><ul><li>Polygon modeling lets you create 3D models based on vertexes, edges and faces.</li><li>Nurbs modeling lets you create 3d models from geometric primitives and drawn curves</li><li>Sculpting tools allows you to create organic sculpts</li><li>Subdivision workflow for better performance in higher pixel counts</li><li>Built in UV editing</li><li>Orthopedic viewport so you can check dimensions from whichever side you need</li></ul><p>Again we are only scratching the surface of what Maya can do. Maya is capable of creating hyper realistic hard surface and organic models for use within animation and also provides all the tools needed to get a perfect rendering. Again system performance is important to consider when choosing software and the minimum requirements are as follows:</p><ul><li>Windows 10 or 11, macOS x or above and linux but see website for compatibility.</li><li>64-bit Intel or AMD multi-core processor with SSE4.2, M series Mac under rosetta 2.</li><li>8GB of RAM but 16GB or more is recommended.</li><li>7GB free disk space for the install.</li><li>Three-button mouse.</li><li>Graphics card please see website for compatibility</li></ul><p>This is a paid software and can be expensive so please consider this when choosing your desired workflow but also consider that this is a complete workflow right up to importing your video file into Filmora so the price may be justified compared to multiple software. Another thing to consider is you can mostly get the desired results you want without the use of a drawing tablet cutting even more cost.</p><h2 id="3DCoat-2022"><a href="#3DCoat-2022" class="headerlink" title="3DCoat 2022"></a>3DCoat 2022</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/3-coat-2022.jpg"                      alt="3 coat 2022"                ></p><p>3DCoat was first released in 2007 and has released constant updates inline with the 3D art community needs. Being a smaller team of developers it’s quite impressive what they have achieved as this is a fully featured 3D art software capable of creating very nice detailed models. When used with the likes of Daz 3D, Keyshot or similar animation software you can easily create the animation you are planning. This is not a full workflow but it is very close to one and the team are constantly releasing updates so one day it might be. You have the ability to UV your models as well as texture, paint and sculpt all within one program and this has one of the most impressive live retopo tools around called voxel modeling mode. Key features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Easy texturing and PBR with the use of smart materials and a HDRL viewport.</li><li>Voxel sculpting with complex boolean operations and adaptive dynamic tessellation.</li><li>Classic polygonal modeling is fully supported and also supports splines and joints.</li><li>Auto-retopology with user-defined edge loops but also fast and easy manual tools.</li><li>Professional tools for creating and editing UV-sets.</li><li>Native global uniform unwrapping algorithms.</li><li>PBR and HDRL rendering for concept exporting.</li><li>Use of scripts for repetitive actions.</li><li>And many more.</li></ul><p>This is paid software but with many options to buy as well as unlimited learning period which you will have to take into consideration when you are deciding to take this in your workflow. And again another consideration is your hardware and 3DCoat is complex due to the complexity of their software , as a point of reference there website states they consider a Surface Pro as the minimal hardware needed to use there software, minimum system specs are as follows:</p><ul><li>64-Bit Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10&#x2F;11, macOS 10.13 High Sierra or higher, Linux Ubuntu 20.04+</li><li>CPU m3 1.00 GHz,</li><li>4GB RAM</li><li>Intel HD Graphics 615</li><li>This will allow painting textures up to 2K and sculpting up to 1 million triangles</li></ul><p>What makes 3DCoat a good choice is the fact they have unlimited learning allowing you to journey into sculpting without putting any money in to start and in confection with other software it is very powerful.</p><h2 id="Blender"><a href="#Blender" class="headerlink" title="Blender"></a>Blender</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/blender-modeling-software.jpg"                      alt="blender modeling software"                ></p><p>So now it’s time to talk about Blender, the Blender institute set off with one main goal in mind and that was to put powerful tools for use with 3D and CG in the hands of artists in the form of free&#x2F;open-source software. This is commendable and they have in large achieved what they set out to do, not only can you sculpt or model in Blender you can also rig and animate and add VFX to your projects.</p><p>It’s impressive to see what you can do with free software and you will be able to achieve very good results. What you miss out on in the form of automation tools and boutique brushes and toolsets this makes up for in an ever-expanding community driven tutorials and guides. With this being free it doesn’t make sense to not have this installed even if you have a different workflow due to the ability to expand with new skills that may work their way into your daily task. Key features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Render with impressive results thanks to cycles,</li><li>An extensive toolset for modeling, curves and retopology</li><li>Sculpting tools provide the power and flexibility needed in several stages of production</li><li>Designed for animation in mind</li><li>Push the boundaries of story art by drawing in a 3d environment</li><li>Powerful post FX and VFX tools like object motion tracking</li><li>Fully customisable UI and controles</li><li>Python API means every tool can be customized and scripted</li></ul><p>Blender is complex software and due to this some functions require different hardware specs but as a rule the higher the CPU speed and cores plus the more RAM you have the more you can do at any given time. With this said the minimum system requirements are as follows@</p><ul><li>Windows 8.1,10 and 11, macOS 10.13 and above and Linux supported</li><li>64-Bit quad core CPU with SSE2 support</li><li>8GB RAM</li><li>Full HD display</li><li>Mouse, trackpad or pen+tablet</li><li>Graphics card with 2GB VRAM, OpenGL 4.3 support</li></ul><p>Blender receives regular updates and is supported by community scripts and content and is becoming a new go to tool for 3D artists in all industries and backgrounds making it a real contender when picking a workflow.</p><p><strong>From Desktop to Portable</strong></p><p>There are lots of options and this list is in no way stating what you may already use is not good enough, this is just what is being used in the industry and is more accessible to a starter or someone who works from home and doesn’t want to spend thousands upfront for their software.</p><p>That being said there is more than just the desktop workflow and some people lead busy lifestyles and are always on the move. This is where I would like to introduce the portable workflow. Due to the fact the Ipad Pro is considered a must have for portable creativity and with recent releases there has never been a better time to start i will be showing Ipad compatible apps.</p><h2 id="Forger-by-Maxon"><a href="#Forger-by-Maxon" class="headerlink" title="Forger by Maxon"></a>Forger by Maxon</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/forger-by-maxon.jpg"                      alt="forger by maxon"                ></p><p>Forger is released as a standalone app or part of the Maxon one. Forger gives you all the tools needed to create sculptures and models on the go which you can be proud of. Designed by artists for artists the features are quite large considering this is running on an ipad and with the seamlessness of importing and exporting to and from software such as cinema 4D this can be worked into your workflow very easily. One feature of Forger that people like to talk about is the ability to use your ipad camera and view your model in the real world using augmented reality.</p><p>Some of the key features of Forger but not limited to are as follows:</p><ul><li>Multi-resolution mesh sculpting via catmull0clark mesh subdivisions.</li><li>Volume-based quad-dominant remeshing.</li><li>Sculpt in layers.</li><li>Sculpt with a mask with the ability to clear, invert, blur, grow and shrink your masks.</li><li>Ability to close holes in existing meshes</li><li>Simple auto-generation of mesh UVs.</li><li>Symmetrical sculpting based on axis of choice</li><li>Ability to reapply symmetry to topologically symmetrical meshes.</li></ul><p>Forger is very powerful and don’t let the fact it’s on an ipad make you think it’s inferior to the bigger desktop software as this is very capable of getting the results you are looking for. It just takes a bit of researching and a different learning curve. Due to the fact it is on an ipad the system requirements are easier to achieve, minimum system requirements are as follows</p><ul><li>IOS 15 or later</li><li>Ipad pro or current model ipad</li></ul><p>A note from the developers, the more complex the model being sculpted, the more RAM required. While there is no screen size requirement, as anticipated the bigger the better when it comes to sculpting workspace.</p><h2 id="Nomad-Sculpt"><a href="#Nomad-Sculpt" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Sculpt"></a>Nomad Sculpt</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/nomad-sculpt-software.jpg"                      alt="nomad sculpt software"                ></p><p>Nomad Sculpt is another contender offering powerful tools that artists can use to sculpt outstanding models for your animations. With a fixed price payment once you buy this you get regular updates and added features meaning you can buy with the confidence you will always have the best tools available. Nomad has a growing community of tutors giving guides and tutorials to get your desired results so no matter your experience Nomad is accessible to you. With the use of voxel remeshing and boolean you can experiment all you like and with the added history feature you can always undo and retrace your steps creating a non destructive workflow and piece of mind. Some of the key features of Nomad are as follows:</p><ul><li>Industry standard sculpting tools like clay, flatten, smooth, mask and cutting tools.</li><li>Stroke parameters can be customized with falloff, alphas and pencil pressure.</li><li>Vertex painting with color, roughness and metalness.</li><li>Work with layers for non destructive modeling.</li><li>Multiresolution sculpting for flexibility.</li><li>Voxel remeshing allows to quickly get uniform levels of detail.</li><li>Dynamic topology even with multiple layers.</li><li>PBR rendering by default with lighting and shadows and switchable matcaps</li><li>Post-processing , screen space reflection, depth of field, ambient occlusion and more</li><li>Customisable user interface</li></ul><p>Again due to being an app the system requirements are open to more users but unlike forger as of the writing of this Nomad is also available on Android giving people more options when choosing. System requirements are as follows:</p><ul><li>Iphone iOS 12.0 or later.</li><li>Ipad iPADOS 12.0 or later.</li><li>Ipod iOS 12.0 or later</li><li>Android 4.4 and up.</li></ul><h2 id="Procreate"><a href="#Procreate" class="headerlink" title="Procreate"></a>Procreate</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/procreate-3d-model.jpg"                      alt="procreate 3d model"                ></p><p>Procreate gets an honorable mention here due to the recent update that added the ability to paint in 3D directly onto your imported OBJ’s. This is a very cool feature as you can paint on different maps directly onto your model and get the exact results you wanted, the prerequisite for this is your OBJ needs to have UV’s already applied when you import into procreate and also this is limited to only three maps as of writing this, they have started they are going to advancing this feature in upcoming updates. Procreate also allows you to use augmented reality to view your models in the real world. Compatibility is as follows:</p><ul><li>Ipad iPadOS 14.4 or later.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can see there are many options and these are just a few or the ever expanding list out there but hopefully this has given you a good starting point with some of the leading industry tools to gain the results you wish. Depending on your setup and space you may lean towards desktop or laptop sculpting or you may be on the move a lot and find the portable option best meets your needs. Either way there is software out there for you to create that perfect sculpt and create the animation you have in your mind. Filmora is very powerful at editing your scenes together ready for uploading and with this guide you will soon be making scene after scene.</p><p><a class="link"

For example, HDR photography involves taking images in dark and bright areas. But because these images might not show much to the naked eyes, you’ll need an HDR program like <strong>EasyHDR</strong>. This software can recreate and design incredible HDR photos on Mac and Windows computers. So, this review post advises you whether <strong>Easy HDR</strong> is worth the money or not. We’ll also advise on the best way to edit and create HDR videos on PC.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR"></a>Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>EasyHDR is an HDR photography software for highlighting image details in HDR photos.

It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.</p><ol><li><strong>Price – 4.7&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there’s a free demo version, it’s pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.</p><ol><li><strong>Supported OS – 5&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus.

Also, if you’re a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want.

In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33&#x2F;lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.</p><p>But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools.

Detailed Review for Easy HDR"></a>Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR</h2><p>Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it’s important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can’t save HDRi in TIFF format. Let’s get in!</p><ol><li><strong>High-Quality Bracket Merging</strong></li></ol><p>A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.</p><ol><li><strong>Editing features</strong></li></ol><p>EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.</p><ol><li><strong>Ghost removal</strong></li></ol><p>No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>HDR batch processing</strong></li></ol><p>As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>LDR enhancement</strong></li></ol><p>Although we’ve mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it’s important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop"></a>Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop</h2><p>Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings.

Even after several years since this feature has been available on the iPad, Apple just added the feature to iPhones with the launch of iOS 14. This feature is a nice creation as it helps users perform numerous tasks and not only focus on one event.</p><p>Thanks to this invention, users can reply to customers’ emails while closing a new lead on Facetime. This article will teach you how to enable and disable the picture in picture mode in Safari on Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Stick with us!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-1.jpg"                      alt="reply emails"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-Mac"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to enable and disable picture in picture in Safari for Mac"></a>Part 1. How to enable and disable picture in picture in Safari for Mac</h2><p>Picture-in-Picture PiP mode is a feature that allows you to view movies in a tiny floating window while surfing another website in Safari or doing something else on your Mac. It remains in the foreground of your screen regardless of which new program you start on your PC.</p><p>To experience Picture in Picture on Mac, you must first launch Safari. You may use Safari’s PiP mode on any video content website. Other browsers do not currently support this functionality.</p><p>Another consideration is that some websites may not support Picture in Picture. In this situation, you will be unable to watch your chosen videos unless you use particular programs that support them. However, because each site operates differently, the procedure you must use to enter this mode may differ.</p><h3 id="Entry-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-on-Mac"><a href="#Entry-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Entry Picture in Picture (PiP) on Mac"></a>Entry Picture in Picture (PiP) on Mac</h3><p>Let’s have a look at how to use Picture in Picture in Safari on Mac:</p><ul><li>After you start Safari, you may go to any website you choose.</li><li>Find the videos you wish to view and press the play button.</li><li>Once it starts playing, you will notice a <strong>small sound icon</strong> at the top tab; you can <strong>right-click or hold control</strong> while clicking on this icon.</li><li>You will notice a drop-down where you can select the <strong>“Enter Picture in Picture.”</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-2.jpg"                      alt="enter picture in picture"                ></p><ul><li>Suppose you opened the video tab only; you will see the small sound icon in the address bar. But if you open other tabs, in that case, you will see the small sound icon on the right side of the tab.</li></ul><p>You can see that utilizing Picture in Picture in Safari for Mac is simple, straightforward, and adaptable. Let’s look at how to get the most of this feature now.</p><h3 id="Using-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-on-Mac"><a href="#Using-Picture-in-Picture-PiP-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Using Picture in Picture (PiP) on Mac"></a>Using Picture in Picture (PiP) on Mac</h3><p>When you enable this feature, the video will shrink and move to a corner on Mac’s screen while still playing. You can perform several tasks to your taste as you keep watching and working. If you feel the size is too small or big, you can resize it by dragging any corner of the video. Furthermore, you can click and pull it to any side of the window if it disturbs your view.</p><p>There is a play and pause button available also as well as the forward and backward if you wish to perform any of these activities. And again, you can decide to turn off this feature by repeating the procedure where you locate the small sound icon. But here, you select the mute this tab instead or click the “<strong>X”</strong> button at the top left corner to stop the video.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to enable and disable picture in picture in Safari for iPhone"></a>Part 2. How to enable and disable picture in picture in Safari for iPhone</h2><p>As we have discussed earlier, users have a way to enable the picture in picture mode before launching iOS14, where the feature is incorporated in the settings. Thanks to Apple’s new APIs, this functionality is no longer limited to watching videos while working on other apps with iOS 15. However, the following procedure is how you can enable the picture in picture mode on your iPhone.</p><ul><li>Go to your iPhone’s <strong>“Settings”</strong> and scroll to the <strong>General</strong></li><li>Search for <strong>Picture in Picture</strong> in the <strong>General</strong> section and click on the option.</li><li>Once it opens, you will see a toggle button for <strong>Start PiP Automatically</strong>; turn it <strong>ON</strong> to enable it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-3.jpg"                      alt="start pip automatically"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You perform the above procedure also to disable the feature. However, in the case of disabling the option, you turn <strong>OFF</strong> the toggle button for <strong>Start PiP Automatically</strong> to disable this function.</p><h3 id="Using-the-Picture-in-Picture-feature-on-iPhones"><a href="#Using-the-Picture-in-Picture-feature-on-iPhones" class="headerlink" title="Using the Picture in Picture feature on iPhones"></a>Using the Picture in Picture feature on iPhones</h3><p>Once you lunch this feature on iOS 14 or greater versions, it automatically shrinks to the top or bottom side of the screen. Here, you can perform several activities with the features, including resizing, moving, and aligning the video with the window. In the case of aligning, depending on your choice, it could be to the screen’s top right, bottom right, top left, and bottom left.</p><p>To move the window to any screen part, simply tap and hold the video to drag and place it on any part of the screen you want. Another fantastic feature the iPhone offers is that it allows you to minimize the picture-in-picture window, and you will keep listening to the audio part of the video while working on other apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-4.jpg"                      alt="move the window to any screen part"                ></p><p>To perform this minimizing feature, grab the window and move it to either side of the screen’s edge. In doing so, the window will disappear, and you will keep hearing the sound only. But, on the screen side, where you move the window, you will see an arrow and a grabber indicating its presence, and you can use it to revive the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-in-safari-for-mac-iphone-ipad-5.jpg"                      alt="move the window to screen&#39;s edge"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-iPad"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-enable-and-disable-picture-in-picture-in-Safari-for-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

At just under $450 on Amazon, this 28-inch Ultra HD monitor gives gamers a top-notch visual experience, impressive calibration options and the ability to work with some of the more powerful graphic cards on the market.</p><p> Affordability was always a major sticking point for 4k UHD monitors. Like its peers, this ASUS product fills a gap in the market and provides a much-improved gaming experience to gamers on a budget. Its 3840 x 2160px resolution makes for a great widescreen view that’s perfect for the sweeping panoramic scenes and epic scales that make video gaming so much fun today.</p><h2 id="ASUS-MG28UQ-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#ASUS-MG28UQ-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="ASUS MG28UQ 4K Monitor Pros and Cons"></a>ASUS MG28UQ 4K Monitor Pros and Cons</h2><p> The ASUS MG28UQ monitor has many great features worth highlighting. For starters, it comes with a TN Liquid Crystal Display screen that boasts an excellent 1ms response rate. It gets even better. This monitor also has AMD FreeSync. At its peak refresh rate, it provides consistently tear-free visuals when paired with compatible graphics cards.</p><p> It also sports a sturdy, fully adjustable stand that can support the monitor in landscape or portrait mode. With its VESA mount, gamers who prefer to mount their monitors on a wall can do so comfortably. And where multiple monitors are needed, the ASUS MG28UQ has visual alignment cues (arrows) that help ensure images display correctly across all screens.</p><p> On the downside however, the quality of imagery on this monitor drops significantly when it’s viewed from side angles. There’s also diminished image contrast when screen brightness is set to maximum. These issues can affect gaming experience where multiple players and viewers are involved. That said, these problems are typical for TN LCD screens which on the upside, have the fastest response rate of most LCD screens on the market today. That’s exactly why they’re perfect for gaming. Many gamers would agree that trading image quality at obscure angles for a synced, tear-free video experience is a fair compromise.</p><p> Another significant downside to this otherwise fantastic gaming monitor is its 60Hz peak refresh rate while in 4k UHD mode. The fact is that hardcore gaming increasingly requires a 144Hz refresh rate and gamers who play at this high refresh rate experience a significant drop in the quality of video gaming at lesser rates. While this 4k UHD monitor can perform at 144Hz theoretically, it’s unable to do so in reality due to the limited bandwidth of its input ports.</p><p> While this shortfall is significant, it is also true that the majority of average gamers use systems whose graphic cards can do no better than 60Hz. This means that for many average gamers, this monitor’s 60Hz limit is not a very serious problem.</p><h2 id="Hardware-Design"><a href="#Hardware-Design" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Design"></a>Hardware Design</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> The ASUS MG28UQ monitor has a sleek and unobtrusive design that’s somewhat different from what you get with flashier gaming monitors. It has even, wide bezels that frame its display without distracting from the screen. It also has a subtle black matte finish that’s bound to appeal to gamers who like minimalist design.</p><p> Its stand is a very critical component of this monitor’s functionality. It is designed to allow the screen to tilt outwards by up to 20 degrees, swivel right and left by 60 degrees, and pivot 90 degrees from landscape to portrait mode. Its 5.9-inch stand is also height adjustable. That’s a good deal of flexibility for a monitor that’s at the affordable end of the price spectrum.</p><p> The ASUS MG28UQ is also VESA compatible. This simply means that it has a standardized apparatus for mounting it safely on a wall. VESA compatibility guarantees that the mount is sufficient for the weight and size of the monitor. The importance of this feature cannot be overstated as inadequate wall mounts can prove very costly indeed.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Ports and Connectivity"></a>2. Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-ports.jpg"                      alt="asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-ports"                ></p><p> It’s hard to fault the ASUS MG28UQ 4K monitor for input connectivity since it features a total of 8 input ports. It includes one HDMI 2.0 port, two HDMI 1.4 ports, one DisplayPort 1.2, three USB 3.0 ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack. This monitor has enough connectivity options to support robust gaming data transfer as well as external media devices like a keyboard, mouse, camera and smartphone. Along with its AMD FreeSync technology, this monitor is built to support a fully-equipped game station for optimal gaming performance.</p><p> It’s also great that while the input panel is located at the lowest side of the monitor, it can easily be reached by pivoting the monitor towards portrait mode. Most non-pivot monitors that have theirs similarly placed can be a hassle to set up. To reach their input panels, gamers must bend themselves uncomfortably or worse, upset the balance of their monitors by tilting them dangerously outward. With its effective pivoting stand, the ASUS MG28UQ is quite easy to set up and use.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-OSD-and-Settings"><a href="#1-OSD-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1.OSD and Settings"></a>1.OSD and Settings</h4><p> This monitor’s On-Screen Menu is accessed through a 5-way joystick located at the back of the monitor. It comes with multiple picture presets such as Racing mode which happens to be its default picture setting.</p><p> In addition to the usual image adjustment menus like brightness, contrast and color temperature, the ASUS MG28UQ monitor also has easy-to-use control menus for its TraceFree and VividPixel technologies, designed to minimize ghosting and boost clarity. Its AMD FreeSync feature, which is active only for DisplayPort inputs, can also be adjusted through the OSD menu.</p><p> GamePlus Technology is a proprietary feature that can also be activated through the OSD. It lets gamers display timers, FPS counters and custom crosshairs for better aiming accuracy.</p><h4 id="2-Color-Performance"><a href="#2-Color-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.Color Performance"></a>2.Color Performance</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-color-accuracy.jpg"                      alt="asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-color-accuracy"                ></p><p> Eye strain is a problem most users experience after hours of non-stop gaming. It helps to have a monitor that can reduce eye strain and improve user comfort. The ASUS MG28UQ monitor is a great choice in this regard. It has an effective Glare Filter as well as Blue Light Reduction and Flicker-Free technologies that mean it can be used comfortably in daylight.</p><p> Despite its ease on the eyes, color management is one area where this monitor is found wanting. The ASUS MG28UQ monitor can display only 96 – 97% of the sRGB color gamut and under 80% of Adobe’s robust RGB gamut. This is significant because color accuracy is very important for professional visual designers who also tend to use 4K UHD monitors. This limitation with color display all but ensures that the ASUS MG28UQ monitor is best used exclusively for gaming. And as a gaming monitor, many would agree that its limited color display capacity is not a deal-breaker.</p><h4 id="3-Gaming-Performance"><a href="#3-Gaming-Performance" class="headerlink" title="3.Gaming Performance"></a>3.Gaming Performance</h4><p> To get the best out of any 4K UHD monitor, it’s absolutely important to have the right Graphics Card. The AMD FreeSync technology that ships with the ASUS MG28UQ monitor activates only when a compatible Graphics Card is detected. With the right GPU in place, FreeSync effectively reduces tearing and image stuttering, making this monitor by and large, a pleasure to use.</p><p> As mentioned above however, even with powerful GPUs, the maximum refresh rate possible on this 4K UHD monitor is 60Hz. In all fairness, this is due to the bandwidth limit on the input ports that ship with this monitor. DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 can easily support 144Hz refresh rates.</p><h4 id="5-Highlighted-Features"><a href="#5-Highlighted-Features" class="headerlink" title="5.Highlighted Features"></a>5.Highlighted Features</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-game-visual-settings.jpg"                      alt="asus-mg28uq-gaming-monitor-game-visual-settings"                ></p><p> ASUS claims their MG28HQ 4K monitor is “built for victory in the gaming arena”. With their exclusive GamePlus and GameVisual technologies, it’s hard to dispute their claim.</p><p> GamePlus lets users set on-screen timers and custom crosshairs that can significantly improve their gaming precision. The crosshairs or reticules can be activated even if the feature is not native to the video game in use. It’s a neat addition that’s sure to play well with most gamers.</p><p> GameVisual is a set of inbuilt presets designed to optimize users’ viewing experience. There’s a Racing mode, a Scenery mode, and an sRGB mode. GameVisual also has a Cinema Mode that’s perfect for watching 4K UHD movies and TV Shows. Its black level, cool hues and optimal saturation make for a great movie watching experience.</p><p> The ASUS MG28UQ 4K monitor also has inbuilt 2 watt speakers that support a 3.5mm headphone jack. While many testers agree they’re not sufficient for gaming purposes, it’s a feature that makes this monitor a solid entertainment device.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> In conclusion, the ASUS MG28UQ monitor is a fantastic gaming and entertainment monitor. It certainly provides excellent gaming performance for its affordable price range. Its fast response rate of 1ms and 4k refresh rate of 60Hz deliver tear-free and steady-streaming imagery for most video games.</p><p> This 4K monitor ships with an adjustable stand is a benefit that cannot be overstated. This feature affords many functional and ergonomic benefits that users will greatly appreciate. Its 8 input ports also make it an ideal centerpiece for a fully equipped gaming station.</p><p> The bottom line is that the ASUS MG28UQ 4K monitor delivers on its maker’s promise. With anticipated improvements to TN LCD screens and input port technologies, future iterations in this product line are likely to overcome the limited color rendering capacity and capped refresh rate of the ASUS MG28UQ 4K monitor.</p><hr><p> Recommend: Use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora scrn Screen Recorder Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to record your gaming and edit your gaming video easily.

However, while these may work at first, twice, or even three times, they rarely produce long-term results.</p><p>Incorporating such <strong>storytelling in marketing</strong> captures attention, entices, and encourages potential customers — everything we need to close a sale. In addition, it encourages intimacy and trust — all of the additives for a fulfilling relationship.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-storytelling-in-marketing-sale-conversation.jpg"                      alt="best of storytelling in marketing sale conversation"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-Storytelling"><a href="#What-is-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="What is Storytelling?"></a>What is Storytelling?</h2><p>Storytelling is an ancient form of interactive personal expression that expresses the narrative while revealing many images and circumstances to the listener. Stories have always facilitated communication. A good story can also be told effectively using photos, images, and movies.</p><p>In line with this, storytelling also seeks to convey an idea by igniting the audience’s imagination through the storyteller’s words to create an image. Using storytelling, you may even write your own digital story. Therefore, inspiring stories serve as motivators and positively impact individuals’ behavior. The skill and influence of emotional storytelling can alter people’s attitudes, instill loyalty, and inspire them to perform specific actions.</p><h2 id="Why-is-Content-Marketing-so-Important"><a href="#Why-is-Content-Marketing-so-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why is Content Marketing so Important?"></a>Why is Content Marketing so Important?</h2><p>Content marketing improves the company’s online reputation. Viewers are served a variety of content in the form of blog entries, videos, infographics, presentations, and social media posts. By providing value, you draw in the audience while establishing brand trust.</p><p>Below are some reasons why successful content marketing storytelling can increase your company’s success.</p><p><strong>1. Develops a powerful brand personality</strong></p><p>Every brand has specific principles and traits that customers connect with, whether you attempt to or not. A brand personality relates to “who” a consumer is speaking with; as a result, a firm must be genuine, incorporate their worldviews, and explain why it matters in the context of their personal story. Storytelling marketing encourages your clients to feel a part of something bigger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/brand-personality-storytelling-marketing-digital.jpg"                      alt="brand personality in storytelling marketing digital"                ></p><p>The company’s story will be distinctive and interesting to the community if you take risky positions and emphasize your company principles. A memorable marketing narrative can make you stand out in a particular field, making you seem more like a friend than a faceless corporation.</p><p><strong>2. Builds an emotional connection and loyalty with customers</strong></p><p>People can identify with and interact with the finest tales because they feel something; as a result, they invest in the brand and what it advocates. The audience is likelier to like you and your business if they can relate to you or comprehend the steps that went into developing the brand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/content-marketing-storytelling-customer-connection.jpg"                      alt="customer connection in content marketing storytelling"                ></p><p>The ability to create emotions through the narrative is a significant weapon since it is kept in mind that people rarely make reasonable judgments. To effectively express your goal, transform it into an engaging story and employ a real storytelling and marketing approach.</p><p><strong>3. Generating new leads</strong></p><p>Lead generation is essential for small businesses because they depend on steady traffic to develop their brand and increase revenue. In addition to being excellent for generating leads, content marketing is also reasonably priced. If your business is working toward objective clients can support, you have a significantly higher chance of success.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/storytelling-and-marketing-generate-new-leads.jpg"                      alt="storytelling and marketing generates new leads"                ></p><p>People prefer to make purchases from organizations they perceive to be sympathetic. It’s simple to see content marketing storytelling’s importance when considering the return on investment. Emotional storytelling reveals your company’s empathy, which will most likely contribute to commercial success.</p><h2 id="How-to-Become-a-Good-Storyteller-for-Marketing"><a href="#How-to-Become-a-Good-Storyteller-for-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="How to Become a Good Storyteller for Marketing?"></a>How to Become a Good Storyteller for Marketing?</h2><p>A great storyteller can make a good narrative even more powerful. Therefore, skilled storytellers can captivate their audience, guide them in the right direction, and leave readers or listeners with new information to assimilate and a lesson they may keep for the rest of their existence.</p><p>The techniques listed below will help you become a better storyteller for marketing.</p><p><strong>1. Pick a compelling main point</strong></p><p>The main moral or message of a great story usually develops throughout. When writing a story, you must know what you are aiming to have. No matter what story you want to tell, it’s important to be certain about the central idea or conceit around which it is built.</p><p><strong>2. Have a clear plot structure</strong></p><p>The story’s narrative acts as its main direction. It ensures the story has a beginning, middle, and end and all the enjoyable material; thus, it creates a comfortable environment for your audience and lets people concentrate on other elements of your marketing narrative. A satisfying conclusion will also give your audience a sense of closure. Only if you are positioning yourself for the following chapter is it permissible to leave your character holding to the cliff’s brink.</p><p><strong>3. Show empathy</strong></p><p>Highly empathic individuals who focus on what other people think and feel are excellent storytellers. When telling stories, using empathy can assist you in choosing the most powerful terminology to describe a perspective that focuses on how you believe your use of language would affect an audience.</p><p><strong>4. Make it your own</strong></p><p>Consider providing a personal touch when delivering a narrative, whether it is to entertain or market a product. Your pitch will have the “genuine” factor with a personal touch. It is communicated through a testimonial. If you’re writing a story to entertain the audience, use your personal experiences to enrich the marketing narrative. This tip will give your story a more genuine sense.</p><p><strong>5. Feature appealing characters</strong></p><p>The character must be endearing if you desire your audience to root to see them succeed. Let your audience witness the development of emotions that your character experiences. Nothing is more depressing than a motionless character. Show them whoever your character is rather than telling them.</p><p><strong>6. Engage your audience</strong></p><p>A key component of effective visual storytelling marketing is engaging your audience, but how you do so largely relies on the type of storytelling marketing you’re doing. Consider your audience whenever you decide how to tell your narrative.</p><h2 id="How-can-Storytelling-in-Marketing-be-Presented-Finally"><a href="#How-can-Storytelling-in-Marketing-be-Presented-Finally" class="headerlink" title="How can Storytelling in Marketing be Presented Finally?"></a>How can Storytelling in Marketing be Presented Finally?</h2><p><strong>1. Text</strong></p><p>Written stories mostly consist of text, though they may also include pertinent imagery. Since this kind of story only needs paper and a pen or even some free writing software like Google Docs, it is also the most accessible and the simplest to write. A blog entry, an essay, and sometimes even a book are effective ways for a written story to reach its intended audience.</p><p>The best example of this type is the “socially aware, designer eyewear at revolutionary pricing” story from <a class="link"   href="https://www.warbyparker.com/history" >Warby Parker. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Instead of merely declaring things are cheap, they provide more context for the assertion by telling a story that explains why they are. He goes so far as to write stories explaining his beginnings on their cleaning cloths, adding a personalized experience and making it more efficient in storytelling and marketing.</p><p><strong>2. Audio</strong></p><p>These stories are very similar to textual stories, except that they are recorded. Technology breakthroughs have made it more accessible than ever to produce audio stories. Podcasts are typically used to tell such a marketing narrative. Great podcasters can blend emotional storytelling into their podcasts to make them entertaining and digestible while inspiring people to act.</p><p>This kind of podcast is exemplified by Camela Thompson from <a class="link"   href="https://calibermind.com/thought-leadership/podcasts/" >CaliberMind’s The Revenue Marketing Report. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Additionally, it is a podcast that primarily serves as a tool for education. On the show’s blogs, the features of each episode are presented, and on the website, you can arrange the episodes by genre.</p><p><strong>3. Photo</strong></p><p>A portion of photographic storytelling includes taking pictures of intriguing situations and events that are difficult to describe in words. These images either convey the tale of a fascinating person or people in an underappreciated setting or take on civil liberties or awareness aspects by highlighting the suffering of those living in impoverished or conflict-torn areas.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Javier-Arcenillas-5e418762e61ba-jpeg%5F%5F880.jpg" >“Latinoamerica,” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> a long-term piece by Javier Arcenilla, is an illustration of this kind. The photographer set out to capture the core of unchecked brutality in Latin America, the political and social forces that tenaciously support it, and the will to stop it. It is regarded as one of the best examples of how photography is used in storytelling in marketing.</p><p><strong>4. Video</strong></p><p>The best tools for collecting and sharing emotions are digital stories. Videos are used to narrate these stories. They cost the most to make, considering that they are the most advanced.</p><p>Fortunately, inexpensive video editing software may give your video story a polished, expert appearance without costing a fortune. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a fantastic video editor for creating content marketing storytelling because it has a handy timeline, the option to merge and edit audio and video recordings separately, powerful effects, and the opportunity to customize the interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong><em>Note: For further details, go to <a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/u2i39suoH5c" >Wondershare Filmora 11 | More Than Just You. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></strong></p><h2 id="Start-Your-Marketing-Storytelling-Tour"><a href="#Start-Your-Marketing-Storytelling-Tour" class="headerlink" title="Start Your Marketing Storytelling Tour"></a>Start Your Marketing Storytelling Tour</h2><p>Content marketing and storytelling go seamlessly together.

Preparing for a Live Podcasting"></a>Part 2. Preparing for a Live Podcasting</h2><p>Preparation and brainstorming are required to make successful live podcasting. We will discuss some key factors to make live podcasting successful here. Let us move step-wise.</p><h3 id="1-Timing-Is-Everything"><a href="#1-Timing-Is-Everything" class="headerlink" title="1. Timing Is Everything"></a>1. Timing Is Everything</h3><p><em>“What is the best time to go live?”</em></p><p>There is no proper answer to this question. Several factors, like your target audience, your niche, and your geographic location, will play a part in the timing of going live. So here, we are going to give you some tips about time management.</p><p>Confirm a schedule with your guest (if you have one), ensuring you’re both on the same page about timing, even if you are not in the same time zone. For example, if you want a maximum live audience in the US, then the best time for you to live stream is when most US live stream viewers are active. You have to make sure your guest should make it to go live as well, irrespective of his time zone.</p><p>Secondly, it is also vital when to hold the live podcasting.

The theme, the guests, the intro of the video, and various question and answer sessions need a script to carry things smoothly.</p><p>The writing is fundamental even if you are going to hold a monologue live podcast. So you have to brainstorm your topics and decide on the podcast theme. You have to invite the guests, give your podcast a name, and get the right equipment and setup.

Set Up Your Podcasting Gear Properly"></a>3. Set Up Your Podcasting Gear Properly</h3><p>Let’s run through various gadgets used to start live podcast streaming and how to make a live podcast. Let’s dive in!</p><p><strong>Camera</strong></p><p>Good display quality is the most integral part of live podcast streaming. Therefore, a reliable camera is essential for a live podcasting kit. The recommended tool for this purpose is a good-quality webcam. Unfortunately, many people use DSLR and mirrorless cameras, which aren’t suitable for shooting for a long time.</p><p>Here we have some fantastic products for you as an option. When it comes to visual fidelity, 4K resolution isn’t everything. Achieving superb quality is highly dependent on webcam light sensors and pixel size. Here are a few recommendations for you.</p><ol><li>Smartphones</li></ol><p>Everyone has a smartphone, and you don’t need to buy a new gadget, making it a cheaper and easier option. But there are difficulties connecting it to your PC or laptop.</p><ol start="2"><li>Webcams</li></ol><p>Many laptops and PC setups have internal webcams. However, the display gets grainy sometimes. You can also go for external webcams. The external webcams are tiny and portable. Maybe, you can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo-pro" >Razor Kiyo Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with more than two micrometers which is superior to other 4K webcams. If you are a beginner with a low budget, you can always go for alternatives.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-6.jpg"                      alt="razor kiyo pro"                ></p><ol start="3"><li>DSLR</li></ol><p>DSLR (digital single-lens reflex camera) is notable for allowing interchangeable lenses on the same camera body. However, it is just one type of digital camera. Investing in DSLR gives options for the future and provides crystal clear images, for example, <a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/compact-digital-cameras/coolpix-b500.html"><strong>Nikon COOLPIX B500</strong></a>. It captures moments in full HD 1080p quality with stereo sound. It also counteracts shaky hands for tripod-steady videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-7.jpg"                      alt="nikon coolpix b500"                ></p><p><strong>XLR or USB Microphone</strong></p><p>You might have heard some things about XLR and USB microphones. For example, “XLR microphones sound more professional” or “USB microphones are less of a hassle.” Unfortunately, XLR can’t be connected directly to your computer. Instead, you’ll need an audio interface to enter the digital world and want to make recordings using your computer or smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-8.jpg"                      alt="atr 2100x-usb"                ></p><ol><li>Condenser Podcasting Microphones</li></ol><p>Sensitive to high frequency and environmental noise. This type of microphone is usually used in recording studios.</p><ol start="2"><li>USB Podcasting Microphones</li></ol><p>Are less sensitive to ambient noise. Traditionally used by beginners.</p><ol start="3"><li>XLR Podcasting Microphones</li></ol><p>3-prong connection connected to mixer and computer. Usually used in professional setups.</p><p><strong>Mixers</strong></p><p>The mixer enhances the exemplary audio quality and offers multi-channel recordings. It also provides multiple-channel live recordings as well. Adding this to your live-streaming podcast kit helps to reduce post-production cuts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-9.jpg"                      alt="yamaha mg series"                ></p><p><strong>Lighting</strong></p><p>Lighting is the most intimidating part of the video live-streaming kit. It enables texture and depth to the video. Not only is the lighting essential, but also the positioning of light. It starts to create shadows on a person’s face. Lighting drastically changes how someone looks in live streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-10.jpg"                      alt="elgato key light mini-portable led panel"                ></p><p><strong>Tripod Stands</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-11.jpg"                      alt="ubeesize 67 phone tripod &amp; selfie stick, and camera tripod stands"                ></p><p>An innovative, sturdy tripod stand can hold your camera and smartphone to capture steady frame shots. There are a lot of tripod stands online as well as in the offline market ranging from inexpensive to expensive ones. You can go for a <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/UBeesize-Wireless-Perfect-Recording-Streaming/dp/B09PH9PNYY/ref=sr%5F1%5F7?keywords=tripod+stands&qid=1667903065&sr=8-7" >UBeesize 67” phone tripod &amp; selfie stick, and a Camera Tripod stands <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for perfect live streaming.</p><p><strong>Computers</strong></p><p>A computer is essential to produce your show via digital audio workspace. You will need it for your post-production and editing software as well. However, a PC or laptop can work equally well in these conditions.</p><p>It is assumed that you already have that gadget. But if you don’t have it and are planning to buy a new machine, you must keep its memory space, processor, and RAM in mind. So here are a few recommendations for you.</p><p><a href="https://www.acer.com/us-en/laptops/aspire/aspire-5"><strong>Acer Aspire 5 Laptops</strong></a> are budget-friendly laptops, starting with 4GB RAM, 256 GB storage, and quad-core processors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-12.jpg"                      alt="acer aspire 5 laptops"                ></p><p><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-pavilion-24-ca1005t-bundle-aio-pc"><strong>HP Pavilion AiO PC</strong></a> is another excellent option for beginners.

Now you don’t have to get to the offices to earn a decent earning. Instead, you can make your home studios have a live podcasting setup. Let’s have a look at it.</p><p><strong>Home Studio</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be hesitant to make a home studio. It has many pros, as it is easy to design and equip a recording home studio. Also, it is a long-term intelligent investing strategy, especially after the covid pandemic. Moreover, it gives a studio-quality recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-14.jpg"                      alt="a home studio"                ></p><p><strong>Place Establishment</strong></p><p>Establishing a new indoor place is much cheaper and safer. However, you need the following items to develop a site for live video streaming.</p><ul><li>A separate room</li><li>Sound absorbers</li><li>Computer</li><li>Microphones</li><li>Mixer</li><li>Tripod Stand</li><li>Proper lighting</li><li>Cables</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> It’ll be better to choose an indoor environment because there is too much uncertainty for outdoor places. For example, you must be aware of people passing by while live streaming a podcast in a quiet park corner. It will be difficult for you to focus. Additionally, an indoor venue can better absorb ambient noise.</p><h3 id="5-Carefully-Choosing-a-Live-Stream-Platform"><a href="#5-Carefully-Choosing-a-Live-Stream-Platform" class="headerlink" title="5.

The original version of the drone was incredibly fun to fly but the Bebop 2 makes new improvements in performance, battery life and video quality. Although the controls for the Bebop are not as precise as some other types of drones on the market like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >DJI Phantom 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the performance and the attractive video that this drone can capture make it a true performance leader in the market.</p><p> The Parrot Bebop is a drone that was in development for over two years since the initial release of the original drone. It comes with a very reasonable price point at under $600 and it is capable of completing over 25 min of autonomous flight before going back to base. The specs on this drone make it a leader in amateur <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >filmmaking, photographs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and more. This is a drone that’s well-suited for use both indoors and outdoors and they commonly go on sale allowing many people to start up their drone hobby without having to invest thousands of dollars.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-bebop-2.jpg"                      alt="parrot bebop 2"                ></p><h2 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-Parrot-Bebop-2"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-Parrot-Bebop-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of Parrot Bebop 2"></a>Pros and Cons of Parrot Bebop 2</h2><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Tt’s extremely lightweight design</li><li>The cameras respectable with a fisheye lens capable of capturing 30 frames per second at 1080 P</li><li>The device can also capture 14 megapixel shots with fairly stable movement</li><li>The battery life has more than doubled allowing up to 25 min of flight time</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Camera functions have not been improved greatly from the previous version</li><li>Image distortions</li><li>The control sticks can also sometimes be quick to go unresponsive long before the parrot reaches its extended service range</li></ul><h2 id="Complete-review-for-Parrot-Bebop-2"><a href="#Complete-review-for-Parrot-Bebop-2" class="headerlink" title="Complete review for Parrot Bebop 2"></a>Complete review for Parrot Bebop 2</h2><h4 id="1-Features-and-specs"><a href="#1-Features-and-specs" class="headerlink" title="1.  Features and specs"></a>1.  Features and specs</h4><p> The main features for this device are it’s improved stable movement with a three axis accelerometer and ultrasound sensor. These improved sensors and waypoint controls make the process of actually flying one of these drones very easy. The motor is also known for its speed and its capable of reaching a height of 100 m in just 18 seconds after takeoff. This is a very fast and highflying drone. The improved battery life of up to 25 min. with a 2700 mA battery is a considerable improvement for this drone as well. The two nicest features which are available for new drone flyers are the return home feature where you can set a waypoint for the drone to land after it runs out of battery as well as the free flight three application. The free flight application is one of the easiest ways that you can control your drone with the help of a tablet or smartphone and set waypoints for capturing the shots you want.</p><h4 id="2-Design"><a href="#2-Design" class="headerlink" title="2.  Design"></a>2.  Design</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-bebop-2-design.png"                      alt="parrot bebop 2 design"                ></p><p> The design of this drone has definitely been improved for performance as well as resiliency. The previous version of the parrot was fairly simple to break but this newest version is much stronger and easier to control especially with the help of the application. This is a drone that has definitely been designed with beginner users in mind. The only design flaw with this drone is that the camera was not updated in any way. Parrot makes the process of ordering extra parts extremely simple through their online store and you can keep this drone running over an extended amount of time quite easily.</p><h4 id="3-Battery-Life"><a href="#3-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="3.  Battery Life"></a>3.  Battery Life</h4><p> The battery life on this drone is excellent for the type of video that shoots as well as the controls offered on the device. Previous versions of the parrot could only fly for 11 min. but this drone can fly uninterrupted for 25 minutes or less. The improved battery life on this drone is comparable with others in the price point but not many of them feature the same quality of image.</p><h4 id="4-Flight-performance"><a href="#4-Flight-performance" class="headerlink" title="4.  Flight performance"></a>4.  Flight performance</h4><p> This is a high-performing drone that has great stability controls and an application that can ease the process of flight. The return home feature helps to protect the drone in the event of a battery problem or when the user is finished filming. As landing these drones can be some of the most difficult aspects of operation, flight performance with a return home feature is one of the easiest ways to protect it.</p><h4 id="5-Control-Range"><a href="#5-Control-Range" class="headerlink" title="5.  Control Range"></a>5.  Control Range</h4><p> Parrot does have an accessory to extend the control range of the Bebop 2 to 2 km. The drone out of the box has a range of 300 m to work with when using the controls. If you plan on using the drone regularly, the extra control range can be very helpful.</p><h4 id="6-Camera"><a href="#6-Camera" class="headerlink" title="6.  Camera"></a>6.  Camera</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-bebop-2-camera.jpg"                      alt="parrot bebop 2 camera"                ></p><p> The 14 megapixel fisheye lens camera is backed up by 8 GB of onboard storage. The cameras capable of capturing 1080 P video at 30 frames per second and it does produce a fairly good quality image. Some users have made light complaints about lens flare and a few other distortion qualities but overall, it’s difficult to find a drone and camera built in combo that can produce an image this good, for the same price.</p><h4 id="7-The-free-flight-app"><a href="#7-The-free-flight-app" class="headerlink" title="7.  The free flight app"></a>7.  The free flight app</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-free-app.gif"                      alt="parrot bebop 2 free app"                ></p><p> The free flight app is a huge asset to this drone. Not only can you use controls from your smart phone or tablet to see from the drone, but you can also set waypoints using the tablet using GPS functions and rely on the autonomous flight capabilities as well as the return home functions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-top-picks-in-gimbals-to-elevate-your-drone-imagery-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Top Picks in Gimbals to Elevate Your Drone Imagery for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-merge-speeches-and-music-into-slides-sequences/"><u>[New] Merge Speeches and Music Into Slides Sequences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-all-encompassing-examination-of-theta-s-camera/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The All-Encompassing Examination of Theta S Camera</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-audio-aficionados-curated-selection-of-free-lut-links-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Audio Aficionados' Curated Selection of Free LUT Links for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-spectral-stories-telling-tales-through-color/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Spectral Stories  Telling Tales Through Color</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-maximize-your-spotify-campaign-roi-an-expert-guide/"><u>[New] Maximize Your Spotify Campaign ROI - An Expert Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-best-android-videography-6-must-try-music-videos-apps-for-2024/"><u>[New] Best Android Videography  6 Must-Try Music Videos Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-ordinary-to-outstanding-photos-ios-and-androids-leading-sticker-adders/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Ordinary to Outstanding Photos  IOS & Android's Leading Sticker Adders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-streamline-content-management-twitter-vids-to-insta-feed/"><u>[New] In 2024, Streamline Content Management  Twitter Vids to Insta Feed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfecting-your-sims-4-live-action/"><u>In 2024, Perfecting Your Sims 4 Live Action</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-make-a-youtube-thumbnail-on-mac/"><u>In 2024, How to Make a YouTube Thumbnail On Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-highest-rated-nintendo-switch-battle-titles-max-156/"><u>In 2024, Highest-Rated Nintendo Switch Battle Titles (Max 156)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/culinary-callings-innovative-naming-for-foodie-channels/"><u>Culinary Callings  Innovative Naming for Foodie Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/5-solutions-for-tecno-camon-20-pro-5g-unlock-without-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>5 Solutions For Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G Unlock Without Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unlock-ig-potential-the-best-tools-for-post-management/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unlock IG Potential  The Best Tools for Post Management</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-elevate-your-audio-experience-top-5-voice-recorder-software-for-phones-and-tablets/"><u>New In 2024, Elevate Your Audio Experience Top 5 Voice Recorder Software for Phones and Tablets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-explore-6-superior-nft-tools-for-artistic-innovation/"><u>[Updated] Explore 6 Superior NFT Tools for Artistic Innovation</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It helps users to take this camera under water up to 10 meters, in mild bumps, splashes and in light rain too.</p><p> On the other side, Garmin is made compatible with the extensive mounting options of GoPro due to addition of slotted connectors. It possesses the miniUSB interface on the boxy shape and the attractive design make is look same as most of mobile devices.</p><h4 id="Fully-Waterproofed"><a href="#Fully-Waterproofed" class="headerlink" title="Fully Waterproofed:"></a><strong>Fully Waterproofed:</strong></h4><p> Here is a big advantage of buying Hero5 Black for adventure sports lovers because this camera can be taken under water up to 60 meter depth with a case. Garmin developers have still added beauty to their camera design even while supporting its waterproofing ability via additional case. It is possible to use the touch screen of this device with this additional casing up to 40 meters. Additionally the water proof case also assists in better mic connectivity so that sound can always stay as clear as it can be without case.</p><h4 id="GPS-Sensors"><a href="#GPS-Sensors" class="headerlink" title="GPS &amp; Sensors:"></a><strong>GPS &amp; Sensors:</strong></h4><p> Garmin design is offering G-Metrix that is an advanced fitness tracking overlay. It consists of so many advanced sensors like gyroscope, barometer, altimeter, accelerometer and magnetometer along with GPS sensor. It can record all major parameters during your workout including the measurement of pace, speed, altitude etc. This advanced unit can also capture data from other sensors like bike speed sensor, heart rate monitor and many more. The Edit software of Garmin assists users to incorporate this data automatically into videos.</p><p> But the GPS feature of GoPro Hero5 Black is not that useful as it works same as you common Instagram and Facebook applications. It simply adds tags to your footage and images saying you visited this place. This basic sensor cannot be used to track other details like Garmin sensors.</p><h4 id="Accessories-in-the-Box"><a href="#Accessories-in-the-Box" class="headerlink" title="Accessories in the Box:"></a><strong>Accessories in the Box:</strong></h4><p> When you will open up the Garmin Virb Ultra 30 box then following things will come out:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/garmin-accessories.jpg"                      alt="garmin-accessories"                ></p><ul><li>Garmin Virb Sticker</li><li>Anti Fog Kit</li><li>Wrench</li><li>Long and Short extension arms</li><li>Long and Short screws</li><li>Vertical mount and standard adapter</li><li>Curved and Flat adhesive mounts</li><li>Charging&#x2F;data cable</li><li>Lithium Ion Battery</li><li>Waterproof Case</li><li>Virb Ultra 30 Action Cam</li></ul><p> On the other side, GoPro Hero5 Black comes with following accessories:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-hero5-black-accessories.jpg"                      alt="gopro-hero5-black-accessories"                ></p><ul><li>USB C Cable</li><li>Mounting Buckle</li><li>Flat and Curved Adhesive Mounts</li><li>Rechargeable Battery</li><li>Frame for Hero5 Black</li><li>Hero5 Black Camera</li></ul><h4 id="Usability-and-Control"><a href="#Usability-and-Control" class="headerlink" title="Usability and Control:"></a><strong>Usability and Control:</strong></h4><p> The 2” LCD touch screen of GoPro device makes navigation much easier and simple controls. You can directly make changes for field of view, frame rate and resolution from bottom layer. When you swipe left then it will call all recorded videos and photos whereas swiping right leads to advanced settings where you can control Raw file formats, white balance, ISO and many more. If we talk about Gramin VIRB Ultra 30 then its screen also offers so many shortcut controls. Left side leads to automatic video and photo setting key. Users find this interface much clearer as compared to GoPro device and the touch screen can be also operated with external housing. Gramin Ultra 30 can be directly connected to mobile application that also assists in live streaming of all recorded videos and photos.</p><h4 id="Video-and-Image-Quality"><a href="#Video-and-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Video and Image Quality:"></a><strong>Video and Image Quality:</strong></h4><p> Hero5 Black can provide stunning video quality even at its HD 1080p resolution level and further much improved with 4K level. It never let footage details go blur but in case of Ultra 30 you can often find little blurred details. The footage colour support also differs by great extend in both cases as GoPro leads to a warn tone whereas Gramin is popular for its cool bias.</p><p> Hero5 Black allows users to create RAW images that can be later processed via additional software programs. Its wide dynamic mode assists in HDR level recording so that all shadows and highlights can be well captured. The addition of 4K resolution in Gramin is a big advantage for users as it leads to much crisp and breathtaking detail for every shoot. As the mics can be easily connected even with external housing so sound quality of this device is much better as compared to its competitor.</p><p> You can check the video from 3:45’’ to get detailed differences.</p><p> Whereas, the Ultra 30 has a better performance in low light.</p><h4 id="Electronic-Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Electronic-Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Electronic Image Stabilization:"></a><strong>Electronic Image Stabilization:</strong></h4><p> Both these devices are designed with electronic image stabilization and it is achieved with the help of software instead of hardware adjustments. Although both device manufacturers have worked upon this feature, yet Hero5 Black is reported to have better performance. Users reveal that Hero5 Black can provide impressive footage stabilization even when it is recorded by mounting camera over helmet while driving bike. This feature makes Hero5 Black camera footage safe from sudden shakes and jerks and is rated better for athletes. You can check the below video to get the detailed information.</p><h4 id="Advanced-Audio-Tracks"><a href="#Advanced-Audio-Tracks" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Audio Tracks:"></a><strong>Advanced Audio Tracks:</strong></h4><p> GoPro is developed with the advanced audio track support that allows users to record audio details in a secondary file and users can even generate three separate tracks with ease. This is actually a cool addition to GoPro series and an auto switch is always ready to reduce noise from recorded audio signals.</p><h4 id="Voice-Control"><a href="#Voice-Control" class="headerlink" title="Voice Control:"></a><strong>Voice Control:</strong></h4><p> Both Hero5 Black and Ultra 30 can be controlled with voice commands but the GoPro unit has more commands and allows better controls. The best part is that GoPro voice control supports seven different languages like: Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, German, Italian, French and English. All these commands can be send via a microphone same as the normal audio signals. For Garmin device this is just an introductory feature, it is not well developed but for beginners it is really good.</p><h4 id="App"><a href="#App" class="headerlink" title="App:"></a><strong>App:</strong></h4><p> GoPro action camera can be better controlled from iOS and Android devices with the help of specially designed GoPro apps. There are five different applications available for GoPro device: Capture, Quick (mobile &amp; desktop), Splice and GoPro Studio. On the other side Gramin Virb can also be controlled from distance via Virb Applications that also allow easy editing of footage. With Virb apps you can also enjoy live streaming on YouTube. Virb application can also be used on Mobile as well as on desktop.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> If you want to develop a unique and beautiful footage, then GoPro is best option for you, It can also lead to much stabilized details even when you record shoots from Karma drone and the Quick editor app can help you to improve details further.

Starting from video effects and video editing to audio additions, here are all the common features used in snowboard cross highlights.</p><p>Pan and Zoom - You will see that still photos are slowly zooming and finally focusing on the main athlete in a group competition. This effect is called pan and zoom effect and it is currently the trending feature in a highlight video with still footage.</p><p>Transition - Transition effects are the most commonly used effects in a highlight video where still photos are used continuously. The transition effects make shifting from one photo to another smooth and eye-pleasing. The video editor you choose to make your highlight video should have ample number of transition effects.</p><p>Slow Motion - You need to have slow motion effect on your snowboard cross finals. This is because you will have to allow your viewers to check out the video footages comfortably to understand the best moments. There is no doubt that video footages are the main selling point in a highlight video and therefore, you have to give enough time on the clips that you collect from social media platforms.</p><p>Motion Tracking - Motion tracking could be the x-factor in any sports event highlight video. Motion tracking is highlighting a particular athlete such as the winner throughout a video clip so that the viewers could understand who the winner is and how he performed. You can highlight the athlete through motion tracking by attaching arrow, text, clipart and likewise.</p><p>Texts and Voiceover - Most highlight videos show titles and texts over the still photos of the event so that the viewers can understand the highlights and moments easily. The titles and texts are shown with animation for better traction. However, there are many professional video creators who prefer voiceover instead of showing texts as voiceover gives a life to the video.</p><h3 id="A-Professional-Video-Editor"><a href="#A-Professional-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="A Professional Video Editor"></a>A Professional Video Editor</h3><p>You need to have all the above-mentioned video effects and audio options in the video editor that you choose to make your video highlights.

Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross"></a>Part 2. Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross</h2><p>When you check out high-quality snowboard cross highlights videos online, you will find that there are certain elements that are common across all such videos. Starting from video effects and video editing to audio additions, here are all the common features used in snowboard cross highlights.</p><p>Pan and Zoom - You will see that still photos are slowly zooming and finally focusing on the main athlete in a group competition. This effect is called pan and zoom effect and it is currently the trending feature in a highlight video with still footage.</p><p>Transition - Transition effects are the most commonly used effects in a highlight video where still photos are used continuously. The transition effects make shifting from one photo to another smooth and eye-pleasing. The video editor you choose to make your highlight video should have ample number of transition effects.</p><p>Slow Motion - You need to have slow motion effect on your snowboard cross finals. This is because you will have to allow your viewers to check out the video footages comfortably to understand the best moments. There is no doubt that video footages are the main selling point in a highlight video and therefore, you have to give enough time on the clips that you collect from social media platforms.</p><p>Motion Tracking - Motion tracking could be the x-factor in any sports event highlight video. Motion tracking is highlighting a particular athlete such as the winner throughout a video clip so that the viewers could understand who the winner is and how he performed. You can highlight the athlete through motion tracking by attaching arrow, text, clipart and likewise.</p><p>Texts and Voiceover - Most highlight videos show titles and texts over the still photos of the event so that the viewers can understand the highlights and moments easily. The titles and texts are shown with animation for better traction. However, there are many professional video creators who prefer voiceover instead of showing texts as voiceover gives a life to the video.</p><h3 id="A-Professional-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#A-Professional-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="A Professional Video Editor"></a>A Professional Video Editor</h3><p>You need to have all the above-mentioned video effects and audio options in the video editor that you choose to make your video highlights.

The iPhone can be an excellent tool for anyone wishing to produce outstanding music videos on a limited budget thanks to the device’s powerful camera features. To get the best results possible, it’s wise to use a tripod, find out more about how your iPhone works, enlist the services of a director and use professional editing software. Read on to find out more about making iPhone music videos.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Using a tripod</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Know the technical details of your iPhone</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: If possible, hire a video director</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Edit on your computer</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Using-a-tripod"><a href="#Part-1-Using-a-tripod" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Using a tripod"></a>Part 1: Using a tripod</h2><p> Footage shot with hand-held iPhones can be jerky, blurry and difficult to watch. To achieve the required level of stability, it’s a great idea to use a tripod. A tripod will help you produce a high-quality music video with a stable picture. Make sure you use a compact tripod that is easy to carry and operate to get the best results.</p><p> A tripod will help you if you are shooting static footage, but if you wish to move around whilst you are recording and still obtain outstanding footage you can use a gimbal. Gimbals are much more affordable than they once were and are ideal for vloggers in particular as well as those shooting action-fuelled scenes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jellyfish-metal-spring-tripod.jpg"                      alt="tripod"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Know-the-technical-details-of-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-Know-the-technical-details-of-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Know the technical details of your iPhone"></a>Part 2: Know the technical details of your iPhone</h2><p> You can record HD video with your rear-facing camera once you have read up on how to do so. The iPhone allows you to shoot 4K video, and you can even determine the number of frames per second you want to capture, in order to create smooth, hi-resolution footage. As long as you have the iPhone 6 or above and it is running on at least iOS 9, you’ll be able to capture 4K footage.</p><p> To enable 4K shooting, you must head to your settings and request it. You can do this by clicking through to Settings &gt; Camera and tapping either Record Video or Record Slow-mo. You can then select the required resolution from the options on your screen. You do need to remember that higher resolutions take up more space on your device. For instance, 4K video at frames per second will require 400MB of space per minute, which is ten times more than 720 HD at 30fps. However, by creating the necessary space, you can obtain outstandingly crisp footage for your music video. You can reduce the level of space needed by choosing 4K at 24fps (135MB per minute) or at 30fps (170MB).</p><p> If you wish to opt for slo-mo video recording, you can shoot in 1080p HD at 120fps (170MB per min) or 240fps (480MB). Whichever option you choose, make sure your device has sufficient space to avoid missing out on the exceptional footage that you require.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Shooting-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="iphone technical details"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-If-possible-hire-a-video-director"><a href="#Part-3-If-possible-hire-a-video-director" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: If possible, hire a video director"></a>Part 3: If possible, hire a video director</h2><p> No matter how confident you are working without a director, you can enhance the quality of your music video even further when you do hire one. A director can help you derive more value from your iPhone and use their knowledge of angles, lighting effects and much more to make the end results surpass your expectations. As you’ll be saving money by shooting your video with your iPhone, you can use the cash you have saved to send your video to the next level and make the outcome truly breathtaking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/director.jpg"                      alt="director"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Edit-on-your-computer"><a href="#Part-4-Edit-on-your-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Edit on your computer"></a>Part 4: Edit on your computer</h2><p> The hard work isn’t over once the shoot has come to an end. By using professional editing software, you can add all sorts of dazzling effects and edit the final piece together in a way that just won’t be possible when using your iPhone alone. Editing software solutions like Filmore offer a range of features to boost the quality of your video including inbuilt audio synthesisers and special video effects, enabling you to match your music with your images perfectly. There are many exceptional music video editing software packages on the market that are simple to use and easy to get to grips with, even if you have little or no existing editing experience. You will almost certainly achieve better results by editing your video using your PC rather than your iPhone.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Many of us have dreamed of creating our own music videos to bring songs to life. Advancements in iPhone technology have made it much easier to turn your music video dreams to reality, whether you’re taking inspiration from the videos of modern stars like Kanye West, Taylor Swift and Rihanna or classic artists such as Madonna, Prince or Michael Jackson. You may be amazed to see the quality of what has been achieved in the world music video by people using little more than an iPhone and professional editing software. You are only limited by your imagination, so why not start thinking about ideas for music videos and plan a shoot today?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/pro-mkv-reader-for-personal-computers-for-2024/"><u>Pro MKV Reader for Personal Computers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-how-to-download-and-personalize-whatsapp-ringtone-on-mobile-for-2024/"><u>[New] Step-By-Step  How to Download and Personalize WhatsApp Ringtone on Mobile for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-enhance-iphone-hd-video-clarity-in-premiere-pro-post-production-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhance iPhone HD Video Clarity in Premiere Pro Post-Production for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-high-tide-gear-surfing-camera-innovations-of-2023/"><u>[Updated] High Tide Gear  Surfing Camera Innovations of 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-garmin-virb-ultra-30-an-insider-look-at-an-adventure-staple/"><u>[New] Garmin VIRB Ultra 30  An Insider Look at an Adventure Staple</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-download-and-convert-youtube-twittersongs-videos-to-mp3/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Download and Convert YouTube Twittersongs (Videos) to MP3</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-your-personalized-playbook-for-nba-live-streaming-top-15-essentials/"><u>2024 Approved  Your Personalized Playbook for NBA Live Streaming (Top 15 Essentials)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/in-2024-fostering-an-online-oasis-paving-the-way-for-a-prolific-youtube-presence/"><u>In 2024, Fostering an Online Oasis  Paving the Way for a Prolific Youtube Presence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/innovative-question-collection-for-lively-podcast-discussions-for-2024/"><u>Innovative Question Collection for Lively Podcast Discussions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-11-innovative-steps-toward-perfect-post-production-colorwork/"><u>[New] In 2024, 11 Innovative Steps Toward Perfect Post-Production Colorwork</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-innovative-strategies-for-top-10-ig-grid-design-software-for-2024/"><u>[New] Innovative Strategies for Top 10 IG Grid Design Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-download-installation-and-operation-simplified-guide-to-ez-grabber/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Download, Installation, and Operation Simplified Guide to EZ Grabber</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/how-to-use-ispoofer-on-realme-c53-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to use iSpoofer on Realme C53?
