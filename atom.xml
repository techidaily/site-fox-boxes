Alternatively, if you are using google drive or drop box, they limit to management space you have unless you have to pay for it.</p><p>I would share some examples of I have been working with a client. One of the things he asked me is to make a large video, edit it and send me within a day. However, it was really difficult for me to put such a large video file, upload it into a hard drive and then ship it. Since the video is too long and I need to compress the video footage. Therefore, I compressed my file using file compression tool and timely sent my task to the client.

If you shoot a video on your cell phone, you need to compress it before sending it to cloud storage as the original file will take up a big space on the cloud storage. In the same way, if you need to send a file via email, you need to reduce the size of your file as you can only send a maximum of 25 MB file.</p><p>You can simply compress your large video file into a compressed or small video file without losing the quality of the final video whether you are using Windows, Mac, iPhone, or whatever the device is. In the same way, you can compress your YouTube videos to easily edit short videos, take less space for uploading, and are buffered fast at the viewer’s end.</p><h2 id="How-do-Compress-a-Long-Video-to-a-Small-Size-2"><a href="#How-do-Compress-a-Long-Video-to-a-Small-Size-2" class="headerlink" title="How do Compress a Long Video to a Small Size?"></a><strong>How do Compress a Long Video to a Small Size?</strong></h2><p>A properly compressed file can easily be uploaded and downloaded and in some cases, playback will be smoother.

For example; a <strong>100MB</strong> video can be compressed into an <strong>8MB</strong> video with no visible difference.</p><p>There are two simple methods to reduce the size of your video:</p><p>Firstly, you can trim the unnecessary beginning and end parts of your video. It will help you reduce the video size.</p><p>Secondly, you can remove the unnecessary audio, if your video looks good without background music, you can delete it to get the extra space. Sometimes, the actions in the video are so powerful that there is no need for audio. In this case, you can remove audio and get space without losing the quality of the video.</p><p>On the other hand, a video compressor can harm your data and corrupt your file so, you should use proper software by following these steps to avoid data loss.

Many podcasters only focus on the podcast’s content, which they should, but ignore the visual identity of the podcast.</p><p>In this guide, we will guide you to design a stunning and unique podcast cover. But before that, we will acquaint you with all the necessary elements of an eye-catching podcast cover image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast cover image"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Round-Up-10-Tips-to-Design-Podcast-Cover-Art"><a href="#Round-Up-10-Tips-to-Design-Podcast-Cover-Art" class="headerlink" title="Round-Up 10 Tips to Design Podcast Cover Art"></a>Round-Up 10 Tips to Design Podcast Cover Art</h2><p>These are not tips but 101 guides on podcast cover-making. All the ten key points mentioned here will enable you to create a podcast cover image that stands out and catch the user’s attention.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134249/18498" target="_top" id="2134249">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134249" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134249/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Make-sure-the-podcast-cover-meets-podcast-platform-requirements"><a href="#1-Make-sure-the-podcast-cover-meets-podcast-platform-requirements" class="headerlink" title="1. Make sure the podcast cover meets podcast platform requirements"></a>1. Make sure the podcast cover meets podcast platform requirements</h3><p>To make your podcast accessible to people worldwide, you have to publish them to podcast platforms, otherwise known as podcast directories. For instance, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts are podcast directories.</p><p>The good thing is most podcast directories have a similar requirement for the podcast cover art dimensions, resolution, and file type. Still, some podcast directories have special needs. So, ensure to know the requirement of each podcast directory that you plan to publish your podcasts on and select the canvas accordingly.</p><p>For instance, the podcast cover size demanded by Apple Podcast is:</p><ul><li>3000 x 3000 pixels</li><li>Resolution of 72 dpi</li><li>JPG or PNG file type</li><li>RGB color-space</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-2.jpg"                      alt="apple podcast cover image"                ></p><p>Google Podcasts, a popular podcast platform among Android users, also has the same or similar requirements for the podcast cover image. That is to say, you do not have to design a podcast cover exclusive to Google Podcasts.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are some platforms that have different requirements. For instance, Spotify mentions the following need for a podcast cover image:</p><ul><li>TIFF, PNG, or JPG format using loss-less encoding</li><li>The highest resolution available</li><li>At least 640px wide and tall</li><li>1:1 aspect ratio</li><li>Encoded with an sRGB color space, 24bits per pixel, with color profiles applied directly.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: The thing to remember is to design podcast covers for all platforms with different requirements. It may seem daunting, but limitations and provisions often unleash a person’s creativity. Needless to say, if you are a professional podcaster and your teammates responsible for podcast cover making, then you can leave it to them.</p><h3 id="2-Straight-to-the-point"><a href="#2-Straight-to-the-point" class="headerlink" title="2. Straight to the point"></a>2. Straight to the point</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-3.jpg"                      alt="podcast straight to the point image"                ></p><p>People often confuse “straight to the point” with plain and simple. However, it is an unjust explanation of what is straight to the point. Additionally, achieving the “straight to the point” scale is not simple.</p><p>Put, “straight to the point” means something that best projects your podcast theme with a user who has never even engaged with your podcast. For instance, if your podcast discusses movies, then do not simply design a podcast cover with the blockbuster sign.</p><p>Instead, brainstorm ideas for what you often differ in the podcast, like a specific genre or movie series. Once you narrow down the ideas, you can design a podcast cover that is straight to the point, i.e., it conveys the message creatively.</p><p>Here are some examples to help you think in the “straight to the point” fashion:</p><p><strong>Example #1 ― Entrepreneurs like it simple, plain, and sophisticated.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-4.jpg"                      alt="podcast straight to the point image"                ></p><p>The above podcast cover designs are related to business. If you carefully review each of them, you will find the human element. The human element is a necessary factor in business-related podcasts. It is what allows business professionals to connect with the experts and attracts them to the podcasts.</p><p>Another thing to review is the color palettes used by the entrepreneurs. The colors used in the podcast cover photos by hosts are often subtle yet bright and reek of sophistication.</p><p><strong>Example #2 ― Comedians Making the Most from Their Podcast Cover Photos.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-5.jpg"                      alt="podcast comedy covers"                ></p><p>Comedy podcasts don’t seem like much, but they have a huge user following. Do you know how? Well, they attract users in bulk with their funky, impressive, and immersive cover images. Notice the clever use of colors on all the podcast cover designs. Moreover, the typography used in these cover images is also unsophisticated and often conveys that this isn’t something serious.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982459">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982459">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982459%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982459/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Avoid-Inappropriate-Words-or-Imagery"><a href="#3-Avoid-Inappropriate-Words-or-Imagery" class="headerlink" title="3. Avoid Inappropriate Words or Imagery"></a>3. Avoid Inappropriate Words or Imagery</h3><p>Swearing and inappropriate imagery is part of today’s taboo culture. However, it offends users. You have to retain that the podcast-listening community is an informed one. It’s not about becoming cool, but it’s about delivering cool information.</p><p>Not to mention, using explicit languages is also restricted by podcast directories, like Apple Podcast and Spotify. So, you may also get banned for using offensive words or imagery in your podcast cover photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-6.jpg"                      alt="podcast explicit covers"                ></p><p>The recent policies of podcast directories like Apple Podcast have changed drastically. For instance, you could have gotten away with using asterisk marks in some words (like sh*t); however, it is not the case today. Your podcast will receive multiple notifications from the platform managers to remove the banner, and in some cases, the directories can also ban you from the platform. So, it is best to play it safe and use professional language, at least in the podcast cover photos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049363/7443" target="_top" id="2049363">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049363" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049363/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Color-Matters"><a href="#4-Color-Matters" class="headerlink" title="4. Color Matters"></a>4. Color Matters</h3><p>There are trends in book cover design and movie cover design, and then comes the trends in podcast cover design. You will be surprised to know the amount of time each podcaster spent on deciding the right color for the cover art.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-7.jpg"                      alt="podcast colors covers"                ></p><p>Color is something that not many businesses pay attention to, but it has a profound effect on users. To just give you an example of how deep businesses think about the color of their business, there is a separate domain after colors: color branding.</p><p>Yes, businesses spent a lot of brainstorming sessions to combine color theory and business. Here are some of the most prominent trends in the podcast world today and their significance:</p><p><strong>Example # 1. Red background with light text</strong></p><p>If you are into sales, you might already be familiar with the concept of red. Basically, red is the color of love, excitement, and anger. And the combination of these emotions allows businesses to create a sense of urgency among users. You can use the same psychology in the podcast world and let new users discover you through this psychological trick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-8.jpg"                      alt="podcast red covers"                ></p><p>Today, almost all domains in the podcast world use the red color and combine it with black or white text to entice users about their podcast episodes. You can find such podcast covers on topics ranging from history to anthropology, psychology to music, and so on.</p><p><strong>Example #2. Blue background with light text</strong></p><p>Blue is the color of trust, competency, and quality. To loosely translate its psychological effects on an average human, blue creates a sense of dependability, logic, and peace. So, if your podcast is on medical topics or something calm, a blue podcast cover photo is the way to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-9.jpg"                      alt="podcast blue covers"                ></p><p>There are numerous other examples like this. For instance, even black ink on a grey palette is a trend. After studying their psychological effects on your users, you can choose from any number of colors and combinations.</p><p>It is important to retain that color psychology is not about tricking people. Instead, it is about learning the effects of color on people mind’s and using one that best describes your episodes. So, research this in-depth and choose a color that resonates with your content and also impresses users.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134243/18498" target="_top" id="2134243">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134243" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134243/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Typography-will-help"><a href="#5-Typography-will-help" class="headerlink" title="5. Typography will help"></a>5. Typography will help</h3><p>A debate that long started at the advent of the internet and is still continuing is the effects of fonts on readability. Some recent <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/learn/serif-vs-sans-serif-fonts/" >studies from Canva have revealed that fonts have a lot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to do with readability. But most important of all, fonts have a huge effect on people’s emotions.</p><p>For instance, serif fonts have long been used in newspapers, magazines, and even web pages. That is why most users associate serif fonts with classical, nostalgic, and often professional or formal.

A user can easily locate and revisit your episodes if you use a unique-looking podcast cover. However, in addition to the unique design of the podcast cover, you should also ensure it is in high resolution.</p><p>Retain that a high-resolution picture speaks about class, professionalism, and sophistication, regardless of what you discuss in the podcast. At the same time, a low-resolution podcast is unsuitable and looks un-classy in the digital era.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Brand-consistency"><a href="#7-Brand-consistency" class="headerlink" title="7.

And a lot of users listen to the podcast via their smart phones, so it is best to use compressed images.</p><p>An ideal podcast cover art dimension is 3000 x 3000 pixels, which is a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Some podcast platforms, like Buzzsprout, do the image compression on their end. So, ensure not to compress the image beforehand, as this will further shrink the size of the image.</p><h3 id="9-Design-for-a-variety-of-sizes-and-re-purpose-your-art"><a href="#9-Design-for-a-variety-of-sizes-and-re-purpose-your-art" class="headerlink" title="9.

The higher the brightness, the more luminous the picture will be. This means that bright and dark scenes will both be more easily identifiable.</p><p>In technical terms, the brightness of a video image is measured in nits. One nit is equal to one candela per square meter. If you have a television or monitor that is rated at 100 nits, it means it has a luminance of 100 Candelas per square meter (cd&#x2F;m2).</p><h4 id="What-should-my-video-brightness-be-3"><a href="#What-should-my-video-brightness-be-3" class="headerlink" title="What should my video brightness be?"></a>What should my video brightness be?</h4><p>The brightness of your videos should always be medium. Too much or too little brightness can make the video look unnatural, and viewers may be able to see details in the video. Also, too much brightness will cause color saturation problems.</p><h4 id="Is-it-easy-to-brighten-a-video-3"><a href="#Is-it-easy-to-brighten-a-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Is it easy to brighten a video?"></a>Is it easy to brighten a video?</h4><p>Video Brightener apps like Filmora are mainly designed to do this task.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Securing-a-Smooth-Pathway-to-Share-SRT-Text-Across-Multiple-Platforms"><a href="#Securing-a-Smooth-Pathway-to-Share-SRT-Text-Across-Multiple-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="Securing a Smooth Pathway to Share SRT Text Across Multiple Platforms"></a>Securing a Smooth Pathway to Share SRT Text Across Multiple Platforms</h2><p>If you’re a content creator, then you should know the importance of adding subtitles to your videos.</p><p>Today, a lot of social media users, especially on Facebook, tend to watch videos without turning on the sounds. But the big question is ‘If your audience doesn’t turn on the sound of your videos, how do they get the message you’re trying to pass?” Well, this is why adding ‘Subtitles’ to your videos is crucial. However, for a subtitle to work, it needs to comply with the structure of a video player or any platform you intend to use it on. And fortunately, SRT is a universal format, making it usable on any social media platform.</p><p>In this guide, you’ll be introduced to the simple methods you can utilize to upload SRT files to social media platforms including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc. But before we proceed, let’s take a look at an overview of the different social media platforms and the subtitle file formats they support.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Social Media Platform</th><th>SRT</th><th>VTT</th><th>STL</th><th>SSA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>YouTube</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Vimeo</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>From the overview table above, it’s obvious you can easily create one SRT file and easily use it on different social media channels. This saves you the stress of creating different subtitle files for each platform. So, without further ado, let’s dive in to find out how to upload and add .srt files to different social media platforms.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos</h2><p>If you’re a YouTube video content creator, but you still don’t know the benefit of adding subtitles to your videos, let’s give you the top two main hints on how subtitles affect your videos;</p><ul><li>Subtitles help your videos to be understood not only by folks who hear and see but also by folks who have hearing problems. Hence helping your video to reach more audience.</li><li>You need subtitles to make your videos SEO rich as phrases in your subtitle can be used as keywords by Google when users search for stuff related to your video online.</li></ul><p>That being said, keep in mind that SRT subtitles and CC are two different things. Although they are often used interchangeably, they are both distinct. The only similarity CC and SRT share is that they’re text version of the audio aspect of videos.</p><p>CC, also known as Close Caption the words spoken in the video, and it allows viewers understand the information being passed in a video without necessarily turning on the volume.</p><p>SRT subtitles, on the other hand, are translations of the word that’s spoken in a video. For example, if you’re streaming Korean movie, but you don’t understand the language, you’d need a translation of the dialogue at the bottom of your screen. The English translation that’s displayed on your screen is known as the SRT subtitles.</p><p>Now you know how subtitles affect your videos, and what the difference between SRT and CC are, let’s proceed to learn how to upload SRT files to YouTube videos.</p><p>Step1Sign in to your YouTube channel and locate the ‘YouTube Creator Studio’. Then select ‘Subtitles’ on the right menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-1.jpg"                      alt="subtitles"                ></p><p>Step2Select the Video that you want to add SRT to. Then click ‘Add Language’ and select the language you wrote your Subtitle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-2.jpg"                      alt="add language"                ></p><p>Step3Click Add under the Subtitle section and upload your SRT file through the pop-up that appears on your screen.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Tweets"><a href="#Part-2-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Tweets" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Upload SRT Files to Tweets"></a>Part 2: Upload SRT Files to Tweets</h2><p>Before now, Twitter users can only upload SRT files to video via the ‘Media Studio’, but this feature was not available to all users, making it difficult for some users to add subtitles to their videos.</p><p>However, the new version of Twitter now allows users to easily add SRT files to their tweets from the ‘Compose Tweet’ area. This made uploading SRT to tweet very straightforward. All you just have to do is to compose a tweet with your video then use the “Upload Caption File (.srt)” option to upload the SRT file. See the process to complete the action below;</p><p>Step1Open Twitter on your device and click the relevant button to compose a new tweet.</p><p>Step2Upload the video you want to add the SRT file to.

Then choose the SRT file that you want to upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-tweets-2.jpg"                      alt="upload caption"                ></p><p>Step4Click Done. Then you’ll see the name of the language in your captions is written</p><p>Step5Now play the video to preview the subtitle and if you’re satisfied, publish your tweet instantly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-tweets-3.jpg"                      alt="tweet instantly"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Your-Vimeo-Video"><a href="#Part-3-Upload-SRT-Files-to-Your-Vimeo-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Upload SRT Files to Your Vimeo Video"></a>Part 3: Upload SRT Files to Your Vimeo Video</h2><p>Vimeo is another platform that’s similar to YouTube.

Hence helping your video to reach more audience.</li><li>You need subtitles to make your videos SEO rich as phrases in your subtitle can be used as keywords by Google when users search for stuff related to your video online.</li></ul><p>That being said, keep in mind that SRT subtitles and CC are two different things. Although they are often used interchangeably, they are both distinct. The only similarity CC and SRT share is that they’re text version of the audio aspect of videos.</p><p>CC, also known as Close Caption the words spoken in the video, and it allows viewers understand the information being passed in a video without necessarily turning on the volume.</p><p>SRT subtitles, on the other hand, are translations of the word that’s spoken in a video. For example, if you’re streaming Korean movie, but you don’t understand the language, you’d need a translation of the dialogue at the bottom of your screen. The English translation that’s displayed on your screen is known as the SRT subtitles.</p><p>Now you know how subtitles affect your videos, and what the difference between SRT and CC are, let’s proceed to learn how to upload SRT files to YouTube videos.</p><p>Step1Sign in to your YouTube channel and locate the ‘YouTube Creator Studio’. Then select ‘Subtitles’ on the right menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-1.jpg"                      alt="subtitles"                ></p><p>Step2Select the Video that you want to add SRT to.

The size of all photos is often reduced in order to make a picture better suited for use on social media. On the other hand, enlarging a photo can be more complicated than it sounds. Increasing the overall number of pixels in a photo can easily cause pixelization, especially if the original photo was in low resolution. Blurriness, JPEG compression artifacts or image noise are also among frequent unwanted side effects of blowing up digital images.</p><p>Choosing the right software can help you avoid the potential dangers of enlarging images, which is the reason why we are going to take you through some of the best online as well as Mac and PC-based image enlargers.</p><p>Learn more details about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to create Magnifying Effects in Videos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Enlarging-Photos-Online-Without-Compromising-Quality"><a href="#Enlarging-Photos-Online-Without-Compromising-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Enlarging Photos Online Without Compromising Quality"></a>Enlarging Photos Online Without Compromising Quality</h2><p>The resolution of an image determines how much that image can be enlarged without losing any quality. For instance, if the photo’s resolution is 600x400 pixels, trying to increase it up to 4000x3000 pixels can cause <strong>blurriness or pixelization</strong>. Let’s have a look at some of the best online tools for enlarging low-resolution photos, without compromising their quality.</p><h4 id="1-PhotoEnlarger"><a href="#1-PhotoEnlarger" class="headerlink" title="1.

In order to import a photo, you can click on the Browse icon and navigate to the folder on your computer where the picture is stored or you can simply drag and drop the file to the <strong>Select Image to Enlarge</strong> area of the tool’s page. <strong>The Scale</strong> value is going to be set to <strong>200%</strong> by default, which means that your image is going to be <strong>doubled in size</strong>, and the PhotoEnlarger platform lets make your photo up to <strong>four times larger than the original</strong>. After selecting the Scale value or inserting new values into the <strong>Width and Height boxes</strong> you just have to click on the <strong>Enlarge button</strong> and wait for the picture to be enlarged.

One option is that you uploaded the video with the wrong rotation. Another possibility is that you took the video with your phone’s camera in the wrong orientation. Finally, Instagram may not have been able to detect the proper orientation of the video, causing it to be shown sideways.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-does-Instagram-keep-flipping-my-video"><a href="#Why-does-Instagram-keep-flipping-my-video" class="headerlink" title="Why does Instagram keep flipping my video?"></a>Why does Instagram keep flipping my video?</h2><p>Because Instagram is built to display videos in landscape mode, it may be flipping your videos sideways. This indicates the video will be rotated to be wider than it is tall, which is the standard video orientation.</p><p>So, when you post a vertical video to Instagram Stories from your camera roll, it is automatically cropped to a 9:16 aspect ratio. Because your phone camera didn’t automatically alter the orientation before you started filming, films filmed horizontally can sometimes be posted sideways.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037350/7443" target="_top" id="2037350">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037350" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037350/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-rotate-videos-for-Instagram"><a href="#How-to-rotate-videos-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How to rotate videos for Instagram?"></a>How to rotate videos for Instagram?</h2><p>Individuals currently choose to capture films utilizing high-resolution cameras rather than large video cameras on mobile devices. However, you may overlook the video’s orientation, resulting in a completely reversed recording.</p><p>Don’t be alarmed! You can easily restore the video to its original state using various free programs (instead of turning your neck to watch the video). Here are a few basic tools for rotating, flipping, and turning your videos (both software and web-based options).</p><p>Many applications and softwares can be used to rotate videoes, but among all of them, Filmora is one of the highly recommended software.</p><h3 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

Predefined aspect ratios such as 16:9, 9:16, 4:5, 1:1, and others are also included to assist you in easily finding the best aspect ratio for YouTube, Instagram, and other sites.

Plain SD Card or Micro SD card</h4><p>You can find various models of Micro SD and simple SD cards in the market, but most of the action cameras need Micro SD cards. The significant difference between both these cards is in their dimensions, as Micro SD cards are much smaller in size.</p><p>All latest devices these days are designed with compact size; hence they support micro-sized memory cards for storage of photos and videos.</p><h4 id="2-Speed-Class"><a href="#2-Speed-Class" class="headerlink" title="2.

It would help if you went to U3 and U1 because when your camera is C10 but does not support U1 or U3, it will provide lower data writing speed.</p><p>If you prefer to work on a 1080p resolution, then Class 10 MicroSD card is best for you. These cards are marked with Full HD capabilities that represent 1080p in this case.

The older versions had smaller ratings mostly up to 64GB, whereas the latest devices like Hero4 Silver&#x2F;Black, Hero5 Session, and Hero5 Black support MicroSD cards up to 128GB.</p><p>If you are going to purchase a new MicroSD card for your device, we suggest you check your device specification and pick the card with maximum capacity that your camera can support.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin

Their movements are mainly controlled by a remote unit in most of the cases whereas few highly advanced designs are operated from computers.</p><p> There are so many varieties of drones that you can easily find in world and all of them are working for different applications so we cannot define any set criteria for their classification. Depending upon the need or applications, they can have variable size and design.</p><p> One of the most common applications of drone technology is in military as it helps to control surveillance related issues with ease. Places where humans cannot enter directly can be easily monitored by an air flying unit and it can also capture photographs of critical locations. Here we are going to discuss various types of drones and for ease of understating they are categorized into four basic sections: Numbers of propellers used inside, their size, flying range and equipments.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Different-types-of-Drones"><a href="#Different-types-of-Drones" class="headerlink" title="Different types of Drones"></a>Different types of Drones</h2><table><thead><tr><th><a href="#propellers">Number of propellers</a></th><th><a href="#size">Size</a></th><th><a href="#range">Range</a></th><th><a href="#equip">Equipment</a></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rotory drone</strong></td><td>multi-rotor drones</td><td>Tricopter</td><td>Very small</td><td>Consumer</td><td>With camera</td></tr><tr><td>Quadcopter</td><td>Mini</td><td>Prosumer</td><td>With FPV</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Hexacopter</td><td>Medium</td><td>Professinal</td><td>With GPS</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Octocopter</td><td>Large</td><td>&#x2F;</td><td>With stabilizers</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Single-rotor drones</td><td>&#x2F;</td><td>&#x2F;</td><td>&#x2F;</td><td>&#x2F;</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fixed-wing drones</strong></td><td>&#x2F;</td><td>&#x2F;</td><td>&#x2F;</td><td>&#x2F;</td><td>&#x2F;</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948881/19272" target="_top" id="1948881">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948881" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948881/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Section-1-According-to-Number-of-Propellers"><a href="#Section-1-According-to-Number-of-Propellers" class="headerlink" title="Section 1: According to Number of Propellers"></a>Section 1: According to Number of Propellers</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/types-of-drones.png"                      alt="drones type by propellers"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135417/19272" target="_top" id="2135417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135417/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><p><strong>Rotory drones</strong></p><h4 id="1-Single-Rotor-Drone"><a href="#1-Single-Rotor-Drone" class="headerlink" title="1.

In this movie about metaverse, everyone living in a world of 2045 spends their time with a virtual reality headset covering their eyes and oblivion to the real world in a bit to navigate the OASIS, a virtual world. The developer launches an Easter egg which he turns into a treasure hunt, promising that whoever finds it takes control of the OASIS. Wade Watts, a character who is an orphan, joins others in search of this Easter egg. Spielberg in this movie refers to pop culture without losing the movie’s futuristic attribute, which makes it a great film. In this movie, the audience or viewer is immersed in reality and virtually. It shows the world’s excesses beyond what we can see at the moment. The characters in the movie realize when they take off their headsets that there isn’t any distinction between the virtual and the true world.
