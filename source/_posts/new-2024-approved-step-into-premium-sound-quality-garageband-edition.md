## Part 2\. GarageBand errors? Why fail to edit, and how to fix

Unfortunately, we encountered some critical errors while using the GarageBand software to edit podcasts. These errors were due to technique or file format problems. The following are the errors you might encounter while using GarageBand to edit podcasts and their perfect fix.

### Error 1: Error while synchronizing audio and MIDI

![error while synchronizing audio and midi](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-9.jpg)

Sometimes, GarageBand fails to synchronize audio and MDI. It happens because the app detected an unusual sample rate that it's unable to process.

**Here are the fixes we recommend for this error**

* Change USB Connection
* Close Background Apps
* Check Sample Rate
* Change the current mic you're using
* Create New Profile on the GarageBand app.

### Error 2: "greyed out" MP3/audio files in GarageBand

![greyed out mp3 or audio files in garageband](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-10.jpg)

GarageBand does not allow the upload of MP3 files with unsupported codecs. So, suppose the podcast file you try to upload is greyed out. Then, chances are GarageBand does not support its codec.

**Here are the fixes we recommend for this error**

To fix this error, you have to change the file from .mp3 to .wav. If you're using your iPhone, you can use a file converter app to operate. But if you're on a macOS, you need to locate the podcast MP3 file, right-click on it, then rename it to be in .wav format.

This [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/CeuA1shy1u4) should walk you through the process better.

![the save file operation failed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-11.jpg)

Another error is the inability to save the file. But this is usually due to problems like running an outdated macOS or iOS, insufficient storage space, Mac or iPhone errors, etc. The best way to fix this error is to do the following;

**Here are the fixes we recommend for this error**

* Update your macOS or iOS to the latest version
* Free up storage space
* Check background running apps and close them.
* Restart your device.

### Error 4: The operation could not be completed

![the operation could not be completed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-12.jpg)

This error kept occurring when we tried to open a project in GarageBand, though it did not appear when we tried to create a new project. It might be due to an outdated version of the app, or there are bugs in your device that compromise the operation.

**Here is how you can fix this error**

* Check for the GarageBand's new update and update it if there's a new version.
* Restart your device.
* Force the app to close.
* Update your device to its latest version.
* Delete the app and download it again.

## Final Words

That's how easily you can edit podcasts in GarageBand. The tool offers incredible features that can help you execute any podcast editing seamlessly, and you don't need to be tech-savvy to operate.

However, if you're looking to edit podcasts on Windows, a tool like Filmora supports the best features that can come in handy for you to operate like a pro. Besides, it's supported on any platform, whether Mac, Windows, Android, or iPhone.
