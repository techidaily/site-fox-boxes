## Part 4: Tips for Making Your Photo Grids Stand Out

Creating photo grids is just an incredible way to grab the attention of your followers and target audience on social media. Here’re a few tips to help you plan out the big picture:

#### 1\. Consistency is the Key

Creating a great grid means being consistent and sticking to the plan. Even one off-beat picture in the wrong order, the wrong filter, or the wrong color can throw your entire look out of the whack. So, having a carefully curated collection of pictures is a must to avoid chaos.

#### 2\. Ensure it Matches Your Brand

Making a photo grid for a marketing campaign or brand promotion? If so, the ultimate goal of your grid isn’t to impress your friends but to build a unified look for your brand. Therefore, ensure you choose pictures and filters that fit the serious and professional tone you are going for.

#### 3\. Make the Most of Photo Editing Tools

Be it Instagram or Facebook, social media is all about compelling visuals. It’s difficult to put together an amazing grid unless the individual photos are also great. Taking advantage of the image editing tools of a good photo grid maker is thus important.
