## Part 1 How to add music to PowerPoint?

Before you add music to PowerPoint, note specific points.

Your presentation size will increase by the size of the MP3 music file you add after the audio files are embedded directly into PPT.

For instance, the size of your presentation will magnify by 17MB if you add a song of 17MB to the presentation.

So, the solution is that you need to compress your file size accordingly.

## Part 4 Add more songs to a PowerPoint presentation

You can add more songs if your slide show plays longer than one song. Yet, find that you're having difficulty synchronizing the Audio with the PowerPoint slideshow. For this purpose, you can use a third-party audio editing tool, such as Wondershare Filmora, to combine the Audio into one file and enjoy it all together. And, this makes how to insert music in PowerPoint even easier than before.

03 [Get music to play throughout a PowerPoint](#Part 3)

04 [Add more songs to a PowerPoint presentation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 How to add music to PowerPoint?

Before you add music to PowerPoint, note specific points.

Your presentation size will increase by the size of the MP3 music file you add after the audio files are embedded directly into PPT.

For instance, the size of your presentation will magnify by 17MB if you add a song of 17MB to the presentation.

So, the solution is that you need to compress your file size accordingly.
