## 10\. CC Search

![cc search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-sites-to-get-free-images-10.JPG)

CC Search is a search engine for Creative Commons photos, which means you can use the images on your website without paying anything. CC Search has an extensive collection of images to choose from, and they are all free. Just type your keyword in the search bar, and you'll find plenty of relevant results.

You can also choose whether you want to display ads on your site. If you want to keep them off completely, there is an option that allows users who visit your site to download high-resolution copies at no cost (as long as they attribute credit).

## Conclusion

And that's it! I hope these sites help you find the perfect image for your project.

Remember, if you're looking for images that aren't copyrighted or stock photos, you should definitely check out our list of websites where you can also download free photos.
