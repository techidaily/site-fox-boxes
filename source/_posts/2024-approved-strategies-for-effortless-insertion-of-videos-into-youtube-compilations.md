**Step 1:** Firstly, you should access YouTube Library and YouTube Playlist tab to stream the playlist in which you want to make changes.

**Step 2:** Now, you should go to the video you want to remove. In the video, you can see the three-dotted symbol of the MORE ACTIONS menu. Here, you should choose the REMOVE FROM PLAYLIST option.

This small process can help you delete the desired video from the playlist and you can add the desired ones as you want.

### Final Words

With all these details, you can easily figure out how to add songs to offline playlist YouTube music, the removal procedure, and how to manage it properly. Based on such information, you can deal with multiple problems and use YouTube in offline mode as well. In case you have any problem regarding playlist creation or anything else, you can focus on proper technical support and some other options.
