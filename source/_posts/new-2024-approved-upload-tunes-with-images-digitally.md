**Step 3:** Add Effects and Animation of Images in Filmora

Click on the video timeline so the "set duration" button can come into view. You can customize the duration of each image along with the effect on the image. You can choose from over 300+ effects for the image. Another cool feature is that with Filmora you can animate the images.

**Step 4:** Add Music To Photos

You can go one of two ways with this. One, you can import a file from your computer. Simply click on “import” and browse for the file. Another way is to use audio from Filmora’s royalty free library.

You can also add effects to the audio using Filmora. There are five main effects that you can produce. They are Echo, Lobby, large room, small room, and phone. You can access them from the “Effects” tab. Just scroll to the audio effects sub-category and you’re good to go.

**Step 5:** Export Finished File

You can edit the images and audio until it suits your needs. You can then export the file as an mp4\. Filmora also offers a range of outputs like avi, webm, mov, f4v, mkv, and more. If you're targeting the output for a device like mobile-friendly or desktop friendly, you can change the settings accordingly.
