#### 2\. **Trimming**

 After you have imported the videos, cut the unnecessary portion of the videos that you are not interested to include, this trimming or cutting should be done before you start the actual editing.  
For that, click on the thumbnails of the videos and then on "play". This will result into playing the video. There are two trimming buttons on the left of the window that you can use for marking the beginning and ending of the clip which you want to include.
