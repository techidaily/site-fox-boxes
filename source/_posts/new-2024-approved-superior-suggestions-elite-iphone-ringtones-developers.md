Step3 Now, a **“Silence Detection”** window will open up in which you can change three parameters, **“Threshold,” “Minimum Silence,” and “Buffer,”** by moving the slider**.** Afterward, you can click **“Start”** to roll automatic silence detection, eliminating all the file's silent parts.

Step4 In this step, emphasize one song over the other. For this, right-click a particular song in the **“Timeline Panel”** and select **“Adjust Audio.”** Now, check the **“Audio Ducking”** feature and click **“OK”** to make changes to the song.

**_P.S.:_** Audio Ducking can automatically lower the volume of one track to make another track clearer when you're recording voiceovers, narrations, translations, podcasts, YouTube videos, and other productions that benefit from lowering background music under speech.

Step6 In the last step, click the **“Create”** option and hit the **“Export”** button to save the file on your PC. Finally, transfer the file to your iPhone using a USB cable, and you’re done!
