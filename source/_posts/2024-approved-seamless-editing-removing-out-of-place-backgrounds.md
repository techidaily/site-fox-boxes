Click on "Select and Mask" and select the “Black and White View.” Now, choose the output to "New Layer with Layer Mask."

Step 2: Expand the Selection

Hold the “CTRL” key and select your layer mask. Go to the "Select" tab, find and expand "Modify," and tap "Expand." Select a suitable number and tap “OK” Next, go to the “Edit” tab and select “Content-Aware Fill."

![expand selection by pixels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-8.jpg)

Step 3: Apply Photo Blur

Right-click on the background layer and choose "Convert to Smart Object." Head over to the "Filter" tab, expand "Blur Gallery," and choose "Tilt-Shift." You can change the field lines to adjust the depth of field for your image and create a smooth transition. You can also control the intensity of the blur from the slider present on the right. Click “OK” and save your image.

Step 1: Remove Background

To start with, insert your image and go to the Properties window. Under "Quick Options," click on the "Remove Background" option. Photoshop will automatically detect your subject and remove the background.

![tap on remove background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-10.jpg)
