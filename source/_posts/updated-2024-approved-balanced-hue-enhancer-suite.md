## Balanced Hue Enhancer Suite

_Before you start working on any video editing, you need to have a good overall understanding of working with color in video. To guide you through the process, we'll explain the basics of color and outline the best color editing software packages and apps for fine-tuning the colors in your footage._

Color sorting is an exciting practice of patience, skillful tinkering, and a feeling for atmosphere. Creating stellar looks for a photo or video is a fun way to create a visual experience while maintaining a level of artistic integrity. While advanced artists may prefer larger software programs like Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve, there are excellent, simpler applications built entirely for beginners. In fact, you don't have to be a beginner to use these apps, as many of them use more manual controls for precise adjustments. The advancements readily available for iOS and iPad these days are stellar, and we're here to help point you in the right direction.

## Part 1\. What is color correction?

Color correction refers to the process of adjusting each clip of footage to meet a consistent standard of appearance. Basically, it's about correcting the underlying image issues by balancing the colors, making white appear white, black appear black, and making sure everything is even. The goal is to match the video footage to a standard that would accurately represent how the human eye would see it.

An example of this is when you are shooting outdoors during the day. During the day, the quality of the sun will change, and some shots of your video will not match. This is why color correction is important because it will make your video look like it was all shot at the same time.

## Part 2\. Best color correction app

Whether it's bad lighting or incorrect camera settings, there are plenty of external factors that can affect your videography and ruin your recordings. If the colors in your video don't look right, don't panic because you can quickly fix the problem with a video color correction app on your Android or iPhone device.

To help you choose, we've compiled a shortlist of the 5 best video color correction apps for your smartphone below.

### Conclusion

The lighting, colors, filters, and effects used in your video can make all the difference. With the video color editing apps on this shortlist, you can quickly edit and enhance the videos you shoot on your mobile devices. Choosing between apps like these can be tricky, so keep an eye out for apps that support these settings:

* Satiety
* Brightness
* Adjust the contrast
* RGB color control
* Gamma curves

Most color correction programs also include additional fundamental functions. You must be able to split, merge, or export your video clips in addition to changing the resolution and quality of the video. With more sophisticated tools, you may upload to social media, use special effects, edit audio, and more.

With apps like Filmora, color correcting is simple and quick to do on mobile devices. Download Filmora for free right now on iPhone and Android if you want to utilize it to make your video clips stand out.
