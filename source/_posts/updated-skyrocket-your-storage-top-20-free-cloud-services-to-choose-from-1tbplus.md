Businesses now use cloud storage instead of local storage drives. Many **cloud storage** providers only offer accounts to businesses.

Here is a compilation of the 20 **best free cloud storage** services:

### No.1 Userscloud.com

However, TeraBox gives its users an incredible 1TB of free storage.

### No.5 Deego

Degoo is a cloud storage service that focuses heavily on consumers and is primarily concerned with photos and videos. For example, it employs some hidden artificial intelligence to highlight your best images. In direct opposition to Degoo Cloud, Google Photos, Apple Photos, and other services have been incorporating features of this kind.

With only a web app available for the desktop, Degoo Cloud relies heavily on its apps for Android and iOS. There are also apps for Samsung and Huawei app. Although the service has few features, it's worth looking at if you need a place to store your photos.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)
