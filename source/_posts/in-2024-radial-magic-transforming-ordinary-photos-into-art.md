## Radial Magic: Transforming Ordinary Photos Into Art

Have you ever seen radial blur pictures? To add a sense of speed to still images, many creators like to add a radial blur effect to their photos. It instantly increases the dramatic effect of the captured pictures.

If you are unaware of the radial blur effect, this article can act as a guide. Through this article, you can learn how to add **radial blur in Photoshop** with the help of simple instructions.

## Part 1: What is a Radial Blur Effect?

The radial blur effect is somehow similar to motion blur. This effect can be created at a slow shutter speed in the camera, or you can move or rotate your cameras in certain ways to create this effect. Many photographers also create a motion blur effect by zooming in at a slow shutter speed. By adding this effect, you will create a tunnel vision in your photos.

## Part 2: How to Add the Radial Blur Effect to Your Photos in Photoshop?

To craft a **radial blur image**, many individuals prefer using [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html). The main reason behind the immense popularity of Photoshop is its polished and well-design interface. Along with an intuitive interface, it also consists of various AI-supported features. You can use its color grading tools to manage the saturation, brightness, hue, and contrast levels of your photo. Moreover, you can also add layers to your photo if you want to bring extra dynamics.

Photoshop also allows you to use its pre-built filters for further modifications. With a single tap, you can apply filters to the photos without making them look artificial or low-quality. Moreover, you can also perform basic photo editing by utilizing the options such as cropping and resizing. Apart from all these distinct features, Photoshop also enables you to add a radial blur effect to the pictures.
