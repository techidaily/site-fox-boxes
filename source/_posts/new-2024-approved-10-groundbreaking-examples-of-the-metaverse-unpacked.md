## Part 1: What a Metaverse Could Look Like?

Metaverse is a combination of different technological elements, including AR, VR, and video where the users live inside a virtual universe. The advocates of Metaverse envision the users playing, working, or remaining connected with their loved ones through everything, from conferences to concerts.

In simple words, it refers to a shared virtual platform, which people will be able to access from various devices and where they will be able to move through virtual environments.

The entire concept might be almost a decade away from being completely recognized but it will require the tech giants to cooperate with each other.

In the month of June, Roundhill Investment, the investment firm, had created an ETF, an exchange-traded fund for tracking profit from the work of Metaverse users. Thereafter, Facebook announced its rebranding.

Today, we only have the primitive forerunners of a real Metaverse, Minecraft, Roblox, and other digital user-created worlds. One of the good examples of this idea is Fortnite, a battle royal video game taking place in a large social world. It is an idea as to what some aspects of the Metaverse might look like. Another incredible aspect is the video-conferencing apps. The only difference between this and the actual thing is the real Metaverse is not going to be limited to one game, app, virtual world, or company. It is going to connect them all.

## Part 2: What Can You Do in the Metaverse?

Here are some great examples of the Metaverse.

[What is Metaverse?](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Metaverse is the rise of unique technology. In case the previous century was considered to be the age of mass production and the growth of the internet, the 21th century will be known for the development and expansion of the virtual world. One of the products of this technological evolution is the Metaverse. This is what we are going to take a look at in this article.

## Part 1: What a Metaverse Could Look Like?

Metaverse is a combination of different technological elements, including AR, VR, and video where the users live inside a virtual universe. The advocates of Metaverse envision the users playing, working, or remaining connected with their loved ones through everything, from conferences to concerts.

![What is Metaverse](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/what-is-metaverse.jpg)

In simple words, it refers to a shared virtual platform, which people will be able to access from various devices and where they will be able to move through virtual environments.

The entire concept might be almost a decade away from being completely recognized but it will require the tech giants to cooperate with each other.

In the month of June, Roundhill Investment, the investment firm, had created an ETF, an exchange-traded fund for tracking profit from the work of Metaverse users. Thereafter, Facebook announced its rebranding.

Today, we only have the primitive forerunners of a real Metaverse, Minecraft, Roblox, and other digital user-created worlds. One of the good examples of this idea is Fortnite, a battle royal video game taking place in a large social world. It is an idea as to what some aspects of the Metaverse might look like. Another incredible aspect is the video-conferencing apps. The only difference between this and the actual thing is the real Metaverse is not going to be limited to one game, app, virtual world, or company. It is going to connect them all.

## Part 2: What Can You Do in the Metaverse?

Here are some great examples of the Metaverse.

### 1\. Ready Player One

Ready Player One, the virtual world in New York Times bestselling books is one of the top examples of what the Metaverse might look like. Science fiction is set in 2045 where people are looking to escape the world affected by climate change, poverty, and war by taking shelter in OASIS- the virtual society that has its own currency.
