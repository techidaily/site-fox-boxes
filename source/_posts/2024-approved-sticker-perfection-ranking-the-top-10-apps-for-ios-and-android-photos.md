**Make adjustments.** You can add text, images, stickers, drawings, and spacing using the buttons next to your meme canvas.

**Make and distribute.** Select how to share and save your meme after clicking "Generate Meme." You can share content via social media apps or your phone, send a link, or download content to your device.

Here are some online generators for your memes [ImgFlip Pro](https://imgflip.com/pro?from=mfaq%5Fwatermark), [Mematics](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.trilliarden.mematic&hl=en), [Memedriod](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/memedroid-funny-memes-gifs/id549014460?mt=8), amongst others.

### Can I create something other than memes using the generator?

Yes! A meme maker is a versatile tool with many uses. For example, you can create various artistic works, such as posters, banners, advertisements, and other custom graphics, by uploading custom images and utilizing all the customizations.

### Remove The Background Of Your Photos

You can also use apps like [Wondershare PixCut](https://pixcut.wondershare.com/personal-use.html) to remove the background of your photos, where you’ll find thousands of sticker packs that you can use to **add stickers** or backgrounds to your images.

The best way to make your photos stand out from the crowd is to remove their backgrounds. Here's how it works.
