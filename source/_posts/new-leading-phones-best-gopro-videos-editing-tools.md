## Part 1: GoPro Video Editing App for Android

### 1.Quik

This is one of the most convenient and easy to use app in GoPro's arsenal. Quik is a free application that would automatically create nicely edited videos within just a few minute's time. The editing process is as simple as it can possibly get; all you have to do is selecting the videos or pictures which you would like to show in the movie from the library and Quik is going to do the rest. However, you can only use the images and videos which are stored in your phone's library. You can also mix the GoPro footage with those of your phones if you want.

### 2.Antix

Antix is a special kind of application that makes use of the motion sensors of your smartphone in order to detect when some exciting action is happening. However, the app developers still haven’t revealed what exactly is deemed exciting by this app. It would recommend the key scenes by a comparison of the recorded motion footage from your phone with the help of the video stream of your GoPro.

This video editor is multiple timeline editing. The slow-motion editor can empower the details of your exciting moments, which means viewers can have more engagement with your GoPro videos.

You can also choose to add any background sound to your video wither from the mic of your phone or from a preselected list of licensed tracks.

### 8\. GoFix

Though your action camera would allow you to take photos in situations in which most other cameras won't allow, your photos are going to be a bit distorted because of the fisheye effect on GoPro. Though many of us prefer the fisheye look, you can always choose to do away with it by using the GoFix app. With the GoFix app, you no longer need to worry about those curved horizons.
