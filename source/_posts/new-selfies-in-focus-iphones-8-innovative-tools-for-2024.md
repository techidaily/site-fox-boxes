Capturing solo images or a group image without leaving out anyone is now fun, easy, and simple with the selfie sticks. Though most of the selfie sticks have the same appearance that consist of a telescopic pole with your iPhone at the end, it varies in features, price, and quality.

So, why still get into such circumstances when selfie sticks can ease all your worries of clicking photos? Here are some of the best selfie sticks iPhone device supports.

## Types of Selfie Sticks

By the classification of usage, we could divide selfie stick into 2 kinds.

### 1\. Blue-tooth Connected Selfie Stick

What is a bluetooth selfie stick? It is basically a device controlled by the Bluetooth connected remote control. How is the selfie stick paired with the blue tooth device? It is definitely a better and convenient, but, a bit pricier idea to use the bluetooth selfie stick. The bluetooth can be paired as simply as connecting bluetooth to other devices. Find the bluetooth setting on your iPhone after pressing a button on the stick. When pairing is done, open the camera app and place your iPhone at the end of the stick to click your desired pictures by pressing the remote control.
