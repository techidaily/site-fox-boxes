 A video card (a graphics card, GPU, video driver, display card, or graphics adapter) is an important part of your computer. Any problem with the video card can affect your PC/laptop performance, spoil your gaming experience, hamper the movie time experience, or slow down 3-D graphics-intensive tasks.

**We will cover the problem in the context of both system’s** integrated video cards (attached to the **motherboard) and dedicated graphics cards like NVidia GeForce, ATI Radeon, and others.**

## **Physical checks before troubleshooting video card problems**

 A graphics card is not always the cause of video problems; sometimes, the problems are caused due to other hardware-related aspects, as follows:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### **1\. Loose connection:**

 Visual issues can be caused due to a loose connection between the computer and the graphics card. Ensure that the video cable is fine and plugged in properly. Replace the faulty cable.

### **2\. Swap graphics card slot:**

 The problem might be due to a faulty PCI card slot. Insert your external graphics card in a different slot and see if this resolves the problem.

### **3\. Check the PC monitor:**

 Video display problems could be monitor-related issues instead of the graphics card. Replacing the monitor may fix the problem.

### **4\. Test another graphics card:**

 If you use a dedicated NVidia GeForce or AMD card, replace it with another card of similar specifications. If the display problem gets fixed, your old graphics card needs repair or replacement.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### **5\. Check your Sound Drivers:**

 Is the computer crashing only while playing games? It may be due to the sound hardware. To check this possibility, disable the sound hardware temporarily via**Device Manager** on your PC. If your computer doesn’t crash now, it’s a sound system issue. Download sound card drivers from the manufacturer’s website.

### **6\. Check the ‘Device Status’ of your graphic card:**

 Go to**Device Manager> Display adapters** . Right-click on your graphic card and click**Properties** . See the**Device Status** If it shows a video card error like Code 43 or Code 12, it indicates a video card problem. Follow the given troubleshooting methods to fix the video card error.

![Device Status of Graphics card showing Code 43](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vv.png)

 If your videos are not playing and the**Device Status** of your graphic card reads –_‘The device is working properly,’_ the video might be corrupt.**In this case, you would need software like** Stellar Repair for Video, which can repair visual and sound corruption in damaged videos. The software fixes video glitches, stuttering, missing sound, video lag, and other problems.

## **How to fix video card problems**

 After the physical checks and fix, if the computer display problem continues, move to the below troubleshooting methods:

1. [**Upgrade video card drivers**](#1)
2. [**Disable and enable the device**](#2)
3. [**Uninstall and reinstall the drivers**](#3)
4. [**Cool and clean video card**](#4)
5. [**Replace your video card**](#5)

### **1\. Upgrade video card drivers**

 Video card driver update fixes bugs and adds new features. It helps to play high-definition videos and games seamlessly. The video stuttering and display problems get resolved after updating your NVidia/Intel HD/AMD card drivers.

**Automatically update PC drivers:**

 Go to**Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update** \> **Check for updates**

**Or**

**Visit the below link for steps to update Windows drivers:**

**_ [Read More](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-10-update-drivers) _**

### **2\. Disable/Enable the graphics card**

 To repair the graphics card ‘no display’ problem, disable/enable the card driver. This method can fix integrated video cards and dedicated (external) graphics cards.

To disable video card drives, follow the below steps:

* Go to**My Computer/ This PC** and right-click on it
* Click on**Manage** \>**Device Manager**
* Double-click**Display Adapters** from the list
* Right-click on the name of your graphic driver
* Click**Disable device**
* Next, reboot your computer.

![enable the graphics card](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-61.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Now, enable the graphics card again by visiting the**Device Manager** on your PC or laptop and following these steps:

* Click**Display Adapters**
* Double-click on your graphic card
* Click on properties.
* Go to the**Driver** tab and click the**Enable** button.

### **3.** **Uninstall and reinstall the drivers**

 Uninstall the graphic drivers and then reboot your PC. Windows will automatically install the drivers after Windows Update.

To uninstall the driver, follow the below steps:

* Go to**My Computer/ This PC** and right-click on it
* Click on**Manage** \>**Device Manager**
* Double-click**Display Adapters** from the list
* Right-click on the graphic driver, click**Uninstall**
* Click OK
* Next, reboot your computer

 Uninstalling display drivers and then reinstalling fixes most of the video card problems. It also fixes the improper display driver installation problem.

> **Note:** NVidia and AMD provide specific tools to uninstall and reinstall graphic drivers. However, these should be only used when the Windows normal uninstall/ reinstall process fails.

### **4\. Cool and clean video card**

 Does your CPU turn hot after some time? Or do your videos and games stop playing properly after a few minutes? It may be because of overheating of the motherboard or video card.

 A c omputer generates heat while it is switched on. If this heat is not dissipated properly, it may damage the motherboard and graphics cards due to overheating. Overheating can cause video card crashes, stuttering, or corrupt video display.

 You must open the machine and check the desk fan to fix the graphics card. It is recommended to seek the help of a PC/laptop technician who may clean the dust inside the fans and install a case fan or component-specific fans to cool down the machine.

 If the motherboard or the dedicated graphic card is damaged due to overheating, you would need to replace them.

### **5\. Replace your video card**

 Buying a new video card is the only option when the existing card is damaged due to overheating or overclocking or has become outdated. If you are using an integrated video card, replace the whole motherboard.

 Before buying, consider the specific use of graphics cards. Gamers or video editing professionals need a more powerful GPU to process intense graphics.

## **To Sum Up**

 Graphics card problems can be related to hardware or software. The blog highlighted a few quick symptoms that identify corruption or damage in your graphics card.

 It recommended physical checks before moving on to the troubleshooting methods. Your graphics card may not always be the cause of poor video quality or performance. It may be due to a faulty cable or display monitor, or the video itself may have become corrupt and needs repair software.

 The troubleshooting methods addressed both hardware and software aspects of video card problems. Hardware issues can be fixed after physically examining the graphics card and maintaining optimal temperature. The video card software issues are resolved by updating or reinstalling the drivers or disabling/enabling the graphics cards.

 If none of these methods works, your graphics card is probably damaged and needs replacement.
