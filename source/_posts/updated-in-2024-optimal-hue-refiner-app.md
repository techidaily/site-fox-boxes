## Optimal Hue Refiner App

_Before you start working on any video editing, you need to have a good overall understanding of working with color in video. To guide you through the process, we'll explain the basics of color and outline the best color editing software packages and apps for fine-tuning the colors in your footage._

Color sorting is an exciting practice of patience, skillful tinkering, and a feeling for atmosphere. Creating stellar looks for a photo or video is a fun way to create a visual experience while maintaining a level of artistic integrity. While advanced artists may prefer larger software programs like Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve, there are excellent, simpler applications built entirely for beginners. In fact, you don't have to be a beginner to use these apps, as many of them use more manual controls for precise adjustments. The advancements readily available for iOS and iPad these days are stellar, and we're here to help point you in the right direction.

## Part 1\. What is color correction?

Color correction refers to the process of adjusting each clip of footage to meet a consistent standard of appearance. Basically, it's about correcting the underlying image issues by balancing the colors, making white appear white, black appear black, and making sure everything is even. The goal is to match the video footage to a standard that would accurately represent how the human eye would see it.

An example of this is when you are shooting outdoors during the day. During the day, the quality of the sun will change, and some shots of your video will not match. This is why color correction is important because it will make your video look like it was all shot at the same time.

If the colors in your video don't look right, don't panic because you can quickly fix the problem with a video color correction app on your Android or iPhone device.

You can alter the color temperature to make your video appear cooler or warmer (using blue or red) or use a few preset grain filters for quick and simple color correction using the color adjustment menu. Additionally, you can add lighting, colors, shadows, and other effects to your video clips.

The standard video editing tools, such as cutting, trimming, and video merging, are available. Using overlays and text graphics, you may also employ animated graphics to make transitions between several video clips. There are additional sound effects and individual music files available.

Adobe Premiere Rush has certain paid features, but once you upgrade, you can make social media-friendly movies with support for up to 4K video output.

Pros

* [Premiere Pro is extremely popular, being included in the Creative Cloud Suite.](https://www.trustradius.com/reviews/adobe-premiere-pro-2018-04-29-00-21-18) So, it has great synergy capabilities. Adobe support is outstanding, and it is the industry standard for the film business.
* Although I appreciate the flexibility I have in Premiere Pro, there are some things that other Adobe tools are superior at. Illustrator is undoubtedly excellent for design.

Cons

* The product needs a fast PC because of the requirements for the video resolution.

### 5\. FiLMiC Pro

**Rating: 3.4/5**

Most of the functionality is free, however, some color correcting settings (such as gamma curve controls) demand a paid upgrade.

### Conclusion

With the video color editing apps on this shortlist, you can quickly edit and enhance the videos you shoot on your mobile devices. Choosing between apps like these can be tricky, so keep an eye out for apps that support these settings:

* Satiety
* Brightness
* Adjust the contrast
* RGB color control

Most color correction programs also include additional fundamental functions.
