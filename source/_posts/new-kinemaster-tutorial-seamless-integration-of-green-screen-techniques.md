## How To Use Green Screen In KineMaster

**Green screen, or chroma key in KineMaster, is a special effects technique. With it, you can replace the background of a video with a different image or video.**

Follow these steps to use the **green screen in KineMaster** to take your video editing to the next level:

Step1 Head to [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexstreaming.app.kinemasterfree&hl=en&gl=US) or [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kinemaster-video-editor/id1609369954) and install **KineMaster** on your device. Launch the app and choose the **aspect ratio**. Tap the **"Media"** option from the right side of the screen. Select the video clips with **chroma-key** and import them to the **timeline.**

Step2 Next, select all the video clips with the **green screen** and open the right-hand side **menu.** Scroll down and tap **"Chroma Key"** to remove the color from the videos.

Step3 Finally, you can further use the filters, animations, overlays, effects, music, and other amazing editing features the app offers. Once you are done, tap the **"Export"** option to save the clip on your device or share it with your family and friends.
