##### Step2 Open up the transition

Once video clips get uploaded, you will see the videos at the interface bottom area. Here, in between the clips, you will find the transition gap(menu). You need to click on it to view all the available transitions.

Note - If there is only one video uploaded, split the video to add the required transition.

There, you need to click on it. Doing so will open multiple transition options (Such as 3D effect, text transition, free-flowing, presentation, and a lot more).

##### Step3 Select the transition effect

Finally, please select the desired ones as per your video requirements and then apply them out of the available transitional effects. To check how that effect works, you can play and see it.
