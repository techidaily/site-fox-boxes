## Best Playlist Transfer Tool Between Music Services

After thoroughly observing each music playlist transfer tool, selecting one depends on your requirements. These can be like how many playlists you need to move, the number of tracks you have in them, how often you need a transfer, the transfer time, and, yes, the accuracy!

However, if we talk about the overall winner, Soundiiz took first place, delivering 98% accuracy. With budget-friendly plans, you can enjoy the Pro version and keep your playlist with you regardless of the platform you are on or will be in the future.
