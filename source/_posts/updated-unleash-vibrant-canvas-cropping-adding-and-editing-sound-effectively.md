### Final Words

All these details will help you understand how to add music on Canva without any hassle or problem. In case you are facing any kind of issues while using Canva, you can check out the guides or contact support. Along with it, you may find a lack of some important features too. Due to it, you may not get results as per your expectations and all. Here, you should be focused on alternatives as we discussed Filmora. It is one of the best video editors that has several features and a big music library. You will get accessibility to the music library and features for free. You should be smart and careful while making a final decision.
