**Image:** The complete package of Bublcam use to consist of 4 different cameras having 5 megapixel capacities where each one of these possess 1.2 mm lens. All these cameras work together to capture a complete 360 degree view with 14 megapixel clarity and the results are fully spherical.

Although none of these will give you full HD experience, size ranges of captured videos are nominal that can be stored easily and images can also be stretched out up to 4 times spaces. If you set your video mode to 1440p video setting then it will lead to decent clarity and wonderful image brightness.

**How to Edit**

 The most amazing thing to know about Bublcam 360 is that captured photographs are automatically stitched inside so that users need not to spend additional time for this task. To capture your photographs you simply need to adjust settings and then press shutter, rest all is managed by the cam itself.
