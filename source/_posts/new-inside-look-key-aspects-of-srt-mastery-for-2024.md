## Part 5: Hot FAQs on SRT files

### 1\. Which Is Better, SRT or VTT?

SRT and VTT are quite similar. However, VTT has more editing options compared to SRT making it easier to play on most video players. Plus, it contains metadata and other advanced options compared to SRT. The only notable downside about VTT, when compared to SRT, is that it can't be played on social media platforms.

### 2\. Are SRT files closed captions?
