## Evaluating Video Space on a 64GB Card

Memory cards and storage devices come in many sizes, just as grocery store bags come in various sizes for transporting customers' food, and each user will choose which size to purchase. Each user will consider various criteria while making this decision, including the size of the videos they intend to save on the SD card.

## How much video can 64GB hold?

Based on the normal video resolution of 4k at 60fps, a 64GB storage device can keep more than 1 hour and 20 minutes of video time.

A 64GB storage device can hold more than 1 hour and 37 minutes of video at a resolution of 2.7k at 120fps. On a 64GB memory card, recording at a resolution of 1080p at 60fps allows for around 5 hours of video time.

## How much video can 128GB hold?

A 128GB memory card may carry about 75 or 76 videos if each film is only 3 minutes long.

The data rate of movies is generally influenced by the format and codec of the videos. When this happens, the time it takes for a memory card of that capacity to fill up can be affected. A normal 128GB memory card should be able to hold up to 24 hours of video at 1080p HD. That data rate must be 8.85MB/s for this to happen.

A normal 128GB memory card should be able to hold up to 24 hours of footage at 1080p at 4k resolution. That data rate must be 8.85MB/s for this to happen. A standard 128GB memory card can hold up to 48 hours of film at 720p at 4k resolution. A data rate of roughly 4.42MB/s is also required.

![64gb-128gb-hold-video-size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/64gb-128gb-hold-video-size-2.jpg)

Go to the Format tab and set the output to the original video format. Then, in the "Settings" panel, click the triangle button below to downsize the video by selecting a lower video resolution, frame rate, or bit rate. If the video format is not important to you, you can choose from various formats such as FLV, MP4, and others, which produce lower files.

### Step 3: Export the file

Now press the Export button to create a considerably smaller file. When it's finished, click "find target" to acquire the compressed file, which you can then freely share with your friends.

The strategy described above is simply one way to reduce the size of a video file during Export. You can also crop out the video frame or change the frame scale to lower the video size.

## More tools to make video smaller

### 1\. Shotcut

Compatibility: Windows/Mac/Linux

Shotcut is another popular solution for consumers wishing to reduce the size of videos without spending any money. Shotcut is more of a video editor than a viewer, and it provides a lot of complex editing features.

You can easily compress video files with Shotcut.

**Step 1: Download Shotcut and import the file**

Download and install Shotcut when you're finished, open Shotcut, and choose Open File to view your video. Click Export in the window's top-right corner to save it in a new file format.

 Baseline Profile is a decent choice in general. This format will most likely shrink your video without losing too much quality.

![64gb-128gb-hold-video-size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/64gb-128gb-hold-video-size-7.jpg)

Compatibility: Online

If you don't want to install or use an app on your computer, many websites will allow you to submit a video file and compress it for you. Some of these services demand registration, others charge a monthly fee (or place a watermark on your movie), and others are free and only require a video file.

VEED.IO is the first service we'll look at. VEED provides a simple video compression tool for free as part of its video editing tools. It works on both Windows and Mac, and it runs entirely within your browser, so no software is required.

**Step 1: Import file:**

Open the web browser and open the veed.io video compressor. Import the video file by clicking on 'Upload a file.'

**Step 2: Compress the file.**

Once your video file is uploaded, you will see the file compressing options on the screen. You can compress the file to the size that you want.

It is to note that the video file size can be reduced to half depending on the length and quality of the video.

![64gb-128gb-hold-video-size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/64gb-128gb-hold-video-size-10.jpg)

**Step 3: Compress and export the file.**

Click on 'Compress file' and wait until the video file is compressed to your preferred size. You can export the file by sharing the video link or downloading the video on your device.

![64gb-128gb-hold-video-size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/64gb-128gb-hold-video-size-11.jpg)
